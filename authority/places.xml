                    <note>The Abu Simbel temples are two massive rock-cut temples at Abu Simbel
                        (Arabic: أبو سمبل‎), a village in Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt, near the
                        border with Sudan. They are situated on the western bank of Lake Nasser,
                        about 230 km southwest of Aswan (about 300 km by road). The complex is part
                        of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the "Nubian Monuments", which run
                        from Abu Simbel downriver to Philae (near Aswan). The twin temples were
                        originally carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC, during the
                        19th Dynasty reign of the Pharaoh Ramesses II. They serve as a lasting
                        monument to the king and his queen Nefertari, and commemorate his victory at
                        the Battle of Kadesh. Their huge external rock relief figures have become
                        iconic. </note>

                        al-ʾIskandariyya; Egyptian Arabic: اسكندرية‎ Eskendereyya; Coptic: ⲣⲁⲕⲟϯ
                        Rakodī; Greek: Αλεξάνδρεια Alexandria) is the second-largest city in Egypt.
                        Alexandria was founded in c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great, king of Macedon
                        and leader of the Greek League of Corinth, during his conquest of the
                        Achaemenid Empire. By the time of the Arab conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, the
                        city had already been largely plundered and lost its significance before
                        re-emerging in the modern era. From the late 18th century, Alexandria became
                        a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most
                        important trading centres in the world, both because it profited from the
                        easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red
                        Sea.</note>

                        Arabic: الْحَمْرَاء‎, romanized: Al-Ḥamrāʾ, pronounced [alħamˈraːʔ], lit.
                        'The Red One') is a palace and fortress complex located in Granada,
                        Andalusia, Spain. It was originally constructed as a small fortress in 889
                        CE on the remains of Roman fortifications, and then largely ignored until
                        its ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Arab
                        Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada, who built its
                        current palace and walls with many beautiful, intricate details. It was
                        converted into a royal palace in 1333 by Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada. After
                        the conclusion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492, the site became the
                        Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received
                        royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially
                        altered in the Renaissance style. In 1526 Charles I &amp; V commissioned a
                        new Renaissance palace better befitting the Holy Roman Emperor in the
                        revolutionary Mannerist style influenced by humanist philosophy in direct
                        juxtaposition with the Nasrid Andalusian architecture, but it was ultimately
                        never completed due to Morisco rebellions in Granada.</note>

                        kilometers to the south of modern-day Minya in the region known as Middle
                        Egypt, the area between Asyut and Memphis. While there are some Old Kingdom
                        burials at the site, it was primarily used during the Middle Kingdom,
                        spanning the 21st to 17th centuries BCE (Middle Bronze Age). To the south of
                        the cemetery is a temple constructed by Hatshepsut and Thutmose III,
                        dedicated to the local goddess Pakhet. It is known as the Cave of Artemis,
                        because the Greeks identified Pakhet with Artemis, and the temple is
                        subterranean. </note>

                        remain visible in parts of Old Cairo. Cairo has long been a centre of the
                        region's political and cultural life, and is titled "the city of a thousand
                        minarets" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture.</note>

                    <note>Thebes (Ancient Greek: Θῆβαι, Thēbai), known to the ancient Egyptians as
                        Waset, was an ancient Egyptian city located along the Nile about 800
                        kilometers south of the Mediterranean. Its ruins lie within the modern
                        Egyptian city of Luxor. Thebes was the main city of the fourth Upper
                        Egyptian nome (Sceptre nome) and was the capital of Egypt for long periods
                        during the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom eras. It was close to Nubia and
                        the Eastern Desert, with its valuable mineral resources and trade routes. It
                        was a cult center and the most venerated city during many periods of ancient
                        Egyptian history. The site of Thebes includes areas on both the eastern bank
                        of the Nile, where the temples of Karnak and Luxor stand and where the city
                        proper was situated; and the western bank, where a necropolis of large
                        private and royal cemeteries and funerary complexes can be found.</note>

                    <note>Wādī Ḥalfā (Arabic: وادي حلفا‎) is a city in the Northern state of Sudan
                        on the shores of "Lake Nubia" (the Sudanese section of Lake Nasser) near the
                        border with Egypt. It is the terminus of a rail line from Khartoum and the
                        point where goods are transferred from rail to ferries going down the lake.
                        The town is located amidst numerous ancient Nubian antiquities and was the
                        focus of much archaeological work by teams seeking to save artifacts from
                        the flooding caused by the completion of the Aswan Dam.</note>
