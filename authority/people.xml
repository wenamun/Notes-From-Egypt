                    <note>Dr. Henry Abbott (1812-1859) was a British physician and amateur collector
                        of Egyptian antiquities who practiced in Cairo. During his residence in
                        Egypt between 1832 and 1852, Dr. Abbott began to accompany archaeologists
                        and explorers on digs and actively participate in excavations throughout the
                        country. The famous Abbott papyrus was named after him.</note>

                    <note>Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali (commonly referred to simply as Abdullah Pasha;
                        1801–?) was the Ottoman governor (wali) of Sidon Eyalet between May 1820 and
                        May 1832, with a nine-month interruption in 1822–23. Like his predecessors
                        Jazzar Pasha and Sulayman Pasha, Abdullah Pasha ruled from the port city of
                        Acre. During his reign, all of Palestine and the Syrian coastline came under
                        his jurisdiction. Among his major military victories was his survival of an
                        imperial-backed siege of Acre in 1822 instigated by the Farhi family in
                        retaliation for Abdullah's execution of his mentor Haim Farhi, the
                        suppression of revolts in Mount Lebanon and Jerusalem in 1824 and 1826,
                        respectively, and the 1831 capture of the Sanur fortress. While Abdullah
                        oversaw a period of relative stability in Syria, during his reign the region
                        also experienced economic reversals and increasing poverty, while Acre's key
                        role as an export center of Levantine cotton and olive oil increasingly
                        diminished. Abdullah was the last governor of Sidon to rule from Acre and
                        his defeat to the forces of Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1832 marked the end of
                        Acre as a political and economic power. Following his defeat, he lived in
                        exile in Egypt and then the Hejaz, where he died.</note>

                        ancient Egyptian deity who appears as a member of the Hermopolitan Ogdoad.
                        Amun was attested from the Old Kingdom together with his wife Amaunet. With
                        the 11th Dynasty (c. 21st century BC), Amun rose to the position of patron
                        deity of Thebes by replacing Montu. After the rebellion of Thebes against
                        the Hyksos and with the rule of Ahmose I (16th century BC), Amun acquired
                        national importance, expressed in his fusion with the Sun god, Ra, as
                        Amun-Ra or Amun-Re.</note>

                        was the symbolic mother of their earthly representatives, the pharaohs. She

                        counterpart, and in this form she had a vengeful aspect that protected him

                        pronunciation: [hɛː.ró.do.tos]; c. 484 – c. 425 BC) was an ancient Greek
                        historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day
                        Bodrum, Turkey). He is known for having written the book The Histories
                        (Greek: Ἱστορίαι Historíai), a detailed record of his "inquiry" (ἱστορία
                        historía) on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars. He is widely considered
                        to have been the first writer to have treated historical subjects using a
                        method of systematic investigation—specifically, by collecting his materials
                        and then critically arranging them into an historiographic narrative. On
                        account of this, he is often referred to as "The Father of History," a title
                        first conferred on him by the first-century BC Roman orator Cicero.</note>

                        Islam. According to Islamic doctrine, he was a prophet, sent to preach and
                        confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other
                        prophets. He is believed to be the final prophet of God in all the main

                        belief. Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity, with the Quran
                        as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic

                        the one-eyed giant son of Poseidon and Thoosa in Greek mythology, one of the
                        Cyclopes described in Homer's Odyssey. His name means "abounding in songs
                        and legends". Polyphemus first appeared as a savage man-eating giant in the
                        ninth book of the Odyssey. In the work of even later authors, however, he is
                        presented as both a successful lover and skilled musician. From the
                        Renaissance on, art and literature reflect all of these interpretations of
                        the giant.</note>

                        March 17, 1822 – January 17, 1863) was the Wāli of Egypt and Sudan from 1854
                        until 1863, officially owing fealty to the Ottoman Sultan but in practice
                        exercising virtual independence. He was the fourth son of Muhammad Ali
                        Pasha. Sa'id was a Francophone, educated in Paris. Under Sa'id's rule there
                        were several law, land and tax reforms.</note>

                    <note>Saint George (Greek: Γεώργιος, d. 23 April 303), also George of Lydda, was
                        a Christian who is accepted as a saint in Christianity. In hagiography, as
                        one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and one of the most prominent military
                        saints, he is immortalized in the legend of Saint George and the Dragon. His
                        memorial, Saint George's Day, is traditionally celebrated on 23
                        April.</note>
