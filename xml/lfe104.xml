         <p>DEAREST ALICK, </p>
         <p> I arrived to-day, after thirty-eight daysâ€™ voyage, one month of ceaseless furious wind.
            My poor men had a hard pull down against it. However I am feeling better than when I
            left Luxor. </p>
         <p> Omar has just brought a whole cargo of your letters, the last of the 26 June. Let me
            know your plans. If you can go up the river I might send the boat beforehand to Minieh,
            so far there is a railway now, which would break the neck of the tedious part of the
            voyage for you if you are pressed for time. I must send this off at once to catch early
            post to-morrow. Excuse haste, I write in all the bustle of arrival.</p>
