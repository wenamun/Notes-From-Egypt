         <p>DEAREST ALICK, </p>
         <p> We arrived here all safe three days ago. I think of starting for Nubia directly after
            Christmas Day, which we must keep here. We have lovely weather. Maurice is going with a
            friend of my friends, a Bedawee, to shoot, I hope among the Abab’deh he will get some
            gazelle shooting. I shall stop at Syaleh to visit the Sheykh’s mother, and with them
            Maurice could go for some days into the desert. As to crocodiles, Inshallah, we will eat
            their hearts, and not they ours. You may rely on it that Maurice is ‘on the head and in
            the eye’ of all my crew, and will not be allowed to bathe in ‘unclean places.’ Reis
            Mohammed stopped him at Gebel Abu’l Foda. You would be delighted to see how different he
            looks; all his clothes are too tight now. He says he is thoroughly happy, and that he
            was never more amused than when with me, which I think very flattering. </p>
         <p> Half of the old house at Luxor fell down into the temple beneath six days before I
            arrived; so there is an end of the _Maison de France_, I suppose. It might be made very
            nice again at a small expense, but I suppose the Consul will not do it, and certainly I
            shall not unless I want it again. Nothing now remains solid but the three small front
            rooms and the big hall with two rooms off it. All the part I lived in is gone, and the
            steps, so one cannot get in. Luckily Yussuf had told Mohammed to move my little
            furniture to the part which is solid, having a misgiving of the rest. He has the most
            exquisite baby, an exact minature of himself. He is in a manner my godson, being named
            Noor ed-Deen Hishan Abu-l-Hajjaj, to be called _Noor_ like me.</p>
