         <p>DEAREST ALICK, </p>
         <p> The unlucky journey to Syria almost cost me my life. The climate is absolute poison to
            consumptive people. In ten days after I arrived the doctor told me to settle my affairs,
            for I had probably only a few days to live, and certainly should never recover. However
            I got better, and was carried on board the steamer, but am too weak for anything. We
            were nearly shipwrecked coming back owing to the Russian captain having his bride on
            board and not minding his ship. We bumped and scraped and rolled very unpleasantly. At
            Beyrout the Sisters of Charity wouldn’t nurse a Protestant, nor the Prussians a
            non-Lutheran. But Omar and Darfour nursed me better than Europeans ever do. Little
            Blackie was as sharp about the physic as a born doctor’s boy when Omar was taking his
            turn of sleep. I did not like the few Syrians I saw at all.</p>
