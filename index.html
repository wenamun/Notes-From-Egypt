				<p>In the 19th century a growing number of Europeans and Americans travelled to
					Egypt. Some came here as early tourists, others for various reasons stayed a
					longer period of time in the country. Often enough they kept contact with
					familiy and friends back in Europe and America by writing letters. Some of those
					letters are well known and popular like those by Florence
					Nightingale. This website is devoted to the lesser known examples.</p>
