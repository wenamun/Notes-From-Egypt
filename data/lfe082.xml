         <p>DEAREST ALICK, </p>
         <p> Since I wrote I have had a bad bilious attack, which has of course aggravated my cough.
            Everyone has had the same, and most far worse than I, but I was very wretched and most
            shamefully cross. Omar said, ‘That is not you but the sickness,’ when I found fault with
            everything, and it was very true. I am still seedy. Also I am beyond measure exasperated
            about my boat. I went up to the _Ata el-Khalig_ (cutting of the canal) to see the great
            sight of the ‘Bride of the Nile,’ a lovely spectacle; and on returning we all but sank.
            I got out into a boat of Zubeydeh’s with all my goods, and we hauled up my boat, and
            found her bottom rotten from stem to stern. So here I am in the midst of wood merchants,
            sawyers, etc., etc., rebuilding her bottom. My Reis said he had ‘carried her on his head
            all this time’ but ‘what could such a one as he say against the word of a Howagah, like
            Ross’s storekeeper?’ When the English cheat each other there remains nothing but to seek
            refuge with God. Omar buys the wood and superintends, together with the Reis, and the
            builders seem good workmen and fair-dealing. I pay day by day, and have a scribe to keep
            the accounts. If I get out of it for £150 I shall think Omar has done wonders, for every
            atom has to be new. I never saw anything so rotten afloat. If I had gone up the Cataract
            I should never have come down alive. It is a marvel we did not sink long ago. </p>
         <p> Mahbrook, Palgrave’s boy, has arrived, and turns out well. He is a stout lubberly boy,
            with infinite good humour, and not at all stupid, and laughs a good real nigger yahyah,
            which brings the fresh breezes and lilac mountains of the Cape before me when I hear it.
            When I tell him to do anything he does it with strenuous care, and then asks, _tayib_?
            (is it well) and if I say ‘Yes’ he goes off, as Omar says, ‘like a cannon in Ladyship’s
            face,’ in a guffaw of satisfaction. Achmet, who is half his size, orders him about and
            teaches him, with an air of extreme dignity and says pityingly to me, ‘You see, oh Lady,
            he is quite new, quite green.’ Achmet, who had never seen a garment or any article of
            European life two years ago, is now a smart valet, with very distinct ideas of waiting
            at table, arranging my things etc. and cooks quite cleverly. Arab boys are amazing. I
            have promoted him to wages—one napoleon a month—so now he will keep his family. He is
            about a head taller than Rainie. </p>
         <p> I intend to write a paper on the various festivals and customs of Copts and Muslims;
            but I must wait to see Abu Seyfeyn, near Luxor, the great Christian Saint, where all go
            to be cured of possession—all mad people. The Viceroy wages steady war against all
            festivals and customs. The _Mahmal_ was burked this year, and the fair at Tantah
            forbidden. Then the Europeans spoil all; the Arabs no longer go to the _Ata el-Khalig_,
            and at the _Dóseh_, the Frangee carriages were like the Derby day. It is only up country
            that the real thing remains. </p>
         <p> To-morrow my poor black sheep will be killed over the new prow of the boat; his blood
            ‘straked’ upon her, and his flesh sodden and eaten by all the workmen, to keep off the
            evil eye; and on the day she goes into the water, some _Fikees_ will read the Koran in
            the cabin, and again there will be boiled mutton and bread. The Christian _Ma-allimeen_
            (skilled workmen) hold to the ceremony of the sheep quite as much as the others, and
            always do it over a new house, boat, mill, waterwheel etc. </p>
         <p> Did I tell you Omar has another girl—about two months ago? His wife and babies are to
            come up from Alexandria to see him, for he will not leave me for a day, on account of my
            constantly being so ailing and weak. I hope if I die away from you all, you will do
            something for Omar for my sake, I cannot conceive what I should do without his faithful
            and loving care. I don’t know why he is so devotedly fond of me, but he certainly does
            love me as he says ‘like his mother,’ and moreover as a very affectionate son loves his
            other. How pleasant it would be if you could come—but please don’t run any risks of
            fatigue or exposure to cold on your return. If you cannot come I shall go to Luxor early
            in October and send back the boat to let. I hear from Luxor that the people are all
            running away from the land, unable to pay triple taxes and eat bread: the ruin is
            universal. The poor Sheykhs el-Beled, who had the honour of dining with the Viceroy at
            Minieh have each had a squeeze politely administered. One poor devil I know had to ‘make
            a present’ of 50 purses. </p>
         <p> How is my darling Rainie? I do so long for her earnest eyes at times, and wonder if I
            shall ever be able to get back to you all again. I fear that break down at Soden sent me
            down a great terrace. I have never lost the pain and the cough for a day since. I have
            not been out for an age, or seen anyone. Would you know the wife of your bosom in a pair
            of pink trousers and a Turkish _tob_? Such is my costume as I write. The woman who came
            to sew could not make a gown, so she made me a pair of trousers instead. Farewell,
            dearest, I dare hardly say how your hint of possibly coming has made me wish it, and yet
            I dread to persuade you. The great heat is quite over with the high Nile, and the air on
            the river fresh and cool—cold at night even.</p>
