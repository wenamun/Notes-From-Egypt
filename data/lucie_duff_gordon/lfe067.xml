         <p>MY DARLING MAURICE, </p>
         <p> I was delighted to get your note, which arrived on New Year’s day in the midst of the
            hubbub of the great festival in honour of the Saint of Luxor. I wish you could have seen
            two young Arabs (real Arabs from the Hedjaz, in Arabia) ride and play with spears and
            lances. I never saw anything like it—a man who played the tom-fool stood in the middle,
            and they galloped round and round him, with their spears crossed and the points resting
            on the ground, in so small a circle that his clothes whisked round with the wind of the
            horses’ legs. Then they threw jereeds and caught them as they galloped: the beautiful
            thing was the perfect mastery of the horses: they were ‘like water in their hands,’ as
            Sheykh Hassan remarked. I perceived that I had never seen _real_ horsemanship in my life
            before. </p>
         <p> I am now in the ‘palace’ at Luxor with my dahabieh, ‘Arooset er-Ralee’ (the Darling
            Bride), under my windows; quite like a Pasha. </p>
         <p> In coming up we had an alarm of robbers. Under the mountain called Gebel Foodah, we
            were entangled in shoals, owing to a change in the bed of the river, and forced to stay
            all night; and at three in the morning, the Reis sent in the boy to say he had seen a
            man creeping on all fours—would I fire my pistol? As my revolver had been stolen in
            Janet’s house, I was obliged to beg him to receive any possible troop of armed robbers
            very civilly, and to let them take what they pleased. However, Omar blazed away with
            your father’s old cavalry pistols (which had no bullets) and whether the robbers were
            frightened, or the man was only a wolf, we heard no more of the affair. My crew were
            horribly frightened, and kept awake till daybreak. </p>
         <p> The last night before reaching Keneh, the town forty miles north of Luxor, my men held
            a grand fantasia on the bank. There was no wind, and we found a lot of old maize stalks;
            so there was a bonfire, and no end of drumming, singing and dancing. Even Omar relaxed
            his dignity so far as to dance the dance of the Alexandria young men; and very funny it
            all was. I laughed consumedly; especially at the modest airs and graces of a great
            lubberly fellow—one Hezayin, who acted the bride—in a representation of a Nubian wedding
            festivity. The new song of this year is very pretty—a declaration of love to a young
            Mohammed, sung to a very pretty tune. There is another, rather like the air of ‘Di
            Provenza al mar’ in the ‘Traviata,’ with extremely pretty words. As in England, every
            year has its new song, which all the boys sing about the streets. </p>
         <p> I hope, darling, you are sapping this year, and intend to make up a bit for lost time.
            I hear you have lost no time in growing tall at all events—‘ill weeds, etc.’—you know
            Omar desires all sorts of messages to you.</p>
