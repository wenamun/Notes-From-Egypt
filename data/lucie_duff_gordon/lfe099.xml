         <p>DEAREST MUTTER, </p>
         <p> I have just received your letters, including the one for Omar which I read to him, and
            which he kissed and said he should keep as a _hegab_ (talisman). I have given him an
            order on Coutts’ correspondents for the money, in case I die. Omar proposes to wait till
            we get to <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName> and then to buy a little house, or a
            floor in one. I am to keep all the money till the house is found, so he will in no way
            be tempted to do anything foolish with it. I hope you approve? </p>
         <p> Janet’s visit was quite an _Eed_ (festival), as the people said. When I got up on the
            morning she was expected, I found the house decked with palm branches and lemon
            blossoms, and the holy flags of Abu-l-Hajjaj waving over my balcony. The mosque people
            had brought them, saying all the people were happy to-day, because it was a fortunate
            day for me. I suppose if I had had a mind to _testify_, I ought to have indignantly torn
            down the banners which bore the declaration, ‘There is no God but God, and Mohammed is
            His Prophet.’ But it appeared to me that if Imaams and Muezzins could send their banners
            to decorate a Christian house, the Christian might manage to endure the kindness. Then
            there was fantasia on horseback, and all the notables to meet the boat, and general
            welcome and jubilation. Next day I went on with Henry and Janet in the steamer, and had
            a very pleasant time to Assouan and back, and they stayed another day here, and I hired
            a little dahabieh which they towed down to Keneh where they stayed a day; after which
            Sheykh Yussuf and I sailed back again to Luxor. As bad luck would have it we had hot
            weather just the week they were up here: since then it has been quite cool. </p>
         <p> Janet has left me her little black and tan terrier, a very nice little dog, but I can’t
            hope to rival Omar in his affections. He sleeps in Omar’s bosom, and Omar spoils and
            pets him all day, and boasts to the people how the dog drinks tea and coffee and eats
            dainty food, and the people say Mashallah! whereas I should have expected them to curse
            the dog’s father. The other day a scrupulous person drew back with an air of alarm from
            Bob’s approach, whereupon the dog stared at him, and forthwith plunged into Sheykh
            Yussuf’s lap, from which stronghold he ‘yapped’ defiance at whoever should object to
            him. I never laughed more heartily, and Yussuf went into _fou rire_. The mouth of the
            dog only is unclean, and Yussuf declares he is a very well-educated dog, and does not
            attempt to lick; he pets him accordingly, and gives him tea in his own saucer, only
            _not_ in the cup. </p>
         <p> I am to inherit another little blackie from Ross’s agency at Keneh: the funniest little
            chap. I cannot think why I go on expecting so-called savages to be different from other
            people. Mabrook’s simple talk about his village, and the animals and the victuals; and
            how the men of a neighbouring village stole him in order to sell him for a gun (the
            price of a gun is a boy), but were prevented by a razzia of Turks, etc. who killed the
            first aggressors and took all the children—all this he tells just as an English boy
            might tell of bird-nesting—delights me. He has the same general notion of right and
            wrong; and yet his tribe know neither bread nor any sort of clothes, nor cheese nor
            butter, nor even drink milk, nor the African beer; and it always rains there, and is
            always deadly cold at night, so that without a fire they would die. They have two
            products of civilization—guns and tobacco, for which they pay in boys and girls, whom
            they steal. I wonder where the country is, it is called Sowaghli, and the next people
            are Mueseh, on the sea-coast, and it is not so hot as Egypt. It must be in the southern
            hemisphere. The new _négrillon_ is from Darfoor. Won’t Maurice be amused by his
            attendants, the Darfoor boy will trot after him, as he can shoot and clean guns, tiny as
            he is Maurice seems to wish to come and I hope Alexander will let him spend the winter
            here, and I will take him up to the second Cataract; I really think he would enjoy it. </p>
         <p> My boat will not return I think for another six weeks. Mr. Eaton and Mr. Baird were
            such nice people! their dragoman, a Maltese, appeared to hate the Italians with
            ferocity. He said all decent people in Malta would ten times rather belong to the
            Mahommedans than to the Italians—after all blood tells. He was a very respectable young
            man, and being a dragoman and the son of a dragoman, he has seen the world, and
            particularly the Muslims. I suppose it is the Pope that makes the Italians so hateful to
            them. </p>
         <p> The post here is dreadful, I would not mind their reading one’s letters if they would
            only send them on. Omar begs we to say that he and his children will pray for you all
            his life, please God, not for the money only but still more for the good words and the
            trusting him. But he says, ‘I can’t say much _politikeh_, Please God she shall see, only
            I kiss her hand now.’ You will hear from Janet about her excursion. What I liked best
            was shooting the Cataract in a small boat; it was fine fantasia.</p>
