         <p>Dearest <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>, </p>
         <p> At last I hope I shall get off in a few days. I have had one delay and bother after
            another, chiefly caused by relying on the fine speeches of Mr. D. On applying straight
            to the French Consulate at <name type="place" ref="#alexandria">Alexandria </name>,
               <name type="person" ref="#janet">Janet</name> got me the loan of the _Maison de
            France_ at <name type="place" ref="#thebes">Thebes</name> at once. M. Mounier, the agent
            to Halim Pasha, is going up to <name type="place" ref="#esneh">Esneh</name>, and will
            let me travel in the steamer which is to tow his dahabieh. It will be dirty, but will
            cost little and take me out of this dreadful cold weather in five or six days. </p>
         <p> _December_ 22.—I wrote the above five days ago, since when I have had to turn out of
            Thayer’s house, as his new Vice-Consul wanted it, and am back at Briggs’. M. Mounier is
            waiting in frantic impatience to set off, and I ditto; but <name type="person" ref="#ismail_pasha">Ismail Pasha</name> keeps him from day to day. The worry of
            depending on anyone in the East is beyond belief. Tell your mother that Lady Herbert is
            gone up the river; her son was much the better for <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name>. I saw Pietro, her courier, who is stupendously grand, he offered <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> £8 a month to go with them; you may imagine how
            Pietro despised his heathenish ignorance in preferring to stay with me for £3. It quite
            confirmed him in his contempt for the Arabs. </p>
         <p> You would have laughed to hear me buying a carpet. I saw an old broker with one on his
            shoulder in the <foreign xml:lang="ar">bazaar</foreign>, and asked the price, ‘eight
            napoleons’—then it was unfolded and spread in the street, to the great inconvenience of
            passers-by, just in front of a coffee-shop. I look at it superciliously, and say, ‘Three
            hundred piastres, O uncle,’ the poor old broker cries out in despair to the men sitting
            outside the coffee-shop: ‘O Muslims, hear that and look at this excellent carpet. Three
            hundred piastres! By the faith, it is worth two thousand!’ But the men take my part and
            one mildly says: ‘I wonder that an old man as thou art should tell us that this lady,
            who is a traveller and a person of experience, values it at three hundred—thinkest thou
            we will give thee more?’ Then another suggests that if the lady will consent to give
            four napoleons, he had better take them, and that settles it. Everybody gives an opinion
            here, and the price is fixed by a sort of improvised jury. </p>
         <p> _Christmas Day_.—At last my departure is fixed. I embark to-morrow afternoon at <name type="place" ref="#boulak">Boulak</name>, and we sail—or steam, rather—on Sunday
            morning early, and expect to reach <name type="place" ref="#thebes">Thebes</name> in
            eight days. I heard a curious illustration of Arab manners to-day. I met Hassan, the
            janissary of the American Consulate, a very respectable, good man. He told me he had
            married another wife since last year—I asked what for. It was the widow of his brother
            who had always lived with him in the same house, and who died leaving two boys. She is
            neither young nor handsome, but he considered it his duty to provide for her and the
            children, and not to let her marry a stranger. So you see that polygamy is not always
            sensual indulgence, and a man may practise greater self-sacrifice so than by talking
            sentiment about deceased wives’ sisters. Hassan has £3 a month, and two wives come
            expensive. I said, laughing, to <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> as we left
            him, that I did not think the two wives sounded very comfortable. ‘Oh no! not
            comfortable at all for the man, but he take care of the women, that’s what is
            proper—that is the good Mussulman.’ </p>
         <p> I shall have the company of a Turkish Effendi on my voyage—a Commissioner of Inland
            Revenue, in fact, going to look after the tax-gatherers in the Saeed. I wonder whether
            he will be civil. <name type="person" ref="#sally">Sally</name> is gone with some English servants
            out to the Virgin’s tree, the great picnic frolic of Cairene Christians, and, indeed, of
            Muslimeen also at some seasons. <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> is gone to a
            _Khatmeh_—a reading of the Koran—at Hassan the donkey-boy’s house. I was asked, but am
            afraid of the night air. A good deal of religious celebration goes on now, the middle of
            the month of Regeb, six weeks before Ramadan. I rather dread Ramadan as <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> is sure to be faint and ill, and everybody else
            cross during the first five days or so; then their stomachs get into training. The new
            passenger-steamers have been promised ever since the 6th, and will not now go till after
            the races—6th or 7th of next month. Fancy the <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name> races! It is growing dreadfully Cockney here, I must go to Timbuctoo:
            and we are to have a railway to <name type="place" ref="#mecca">Mecca</name>, and take
            return tickets for the _Haj_ from all parts of the world.</p>
