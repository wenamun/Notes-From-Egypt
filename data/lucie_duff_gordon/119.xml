         <p>Dearest <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>, </p>
         <p> I am sure you will rejoice to hear that I am really better. I now feel so much like
            living on a bit longer that I will ask you to send me a cargo of medicines. I didn’t
            think it worth while before to ask for anything to be sent to me that could not be
            forwarded to Hades, but my old body seems very tough and I fancy I have still one or two
            of my nine lives left. </p>
         <p> I hope to sail in a very few days, <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name> is
            going up to <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name> so I send this by him.
            Yesterday was little Rainie’s birthday, and I thought very longingly of her. The photo,
            of Leighton’s sketch of <name type="person" ref="#janet">Janet</name> I like very much.
         </p>
