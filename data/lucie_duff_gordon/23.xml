         <p>Dearest <foreign xml:lang="de"><name type="person" ref="#sarah_austin">Mutter</name></foreign>, </p>
         <p> After infinite delays and worries, we are at last on board, and shall sail to-morrow
            morning. After all was comfortably settled, <name type="person" ref="#ismail_pasha">Ismail Pasha</name> sent for _all_ the steamers up to Rhoda, near <name type="place" ref="#minieh">Minieh</name>, and at the same time ordered a Turkish General to come
            up instantly somehow. So Latif Pasha, the head of the steamers, had to turn me out of
            the best cabin, and if I had not come myself, and taken rather forcible possession of
            the forecastle cabin, the servants of the Turkish General would not have allowed <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> to embark the baggage. He had been waiting all
            the morning in despair on the bank; but at four I arrived, and ordered the _hammals_ to
            carry the goods into the forecabin, and walked on board myself, where the Arab captain
            pantomimically placed me in his right eye and on the top of his head. Once installed,
            this has become a <foreign xml:lang="ar">hareem</foreign>, and I may defy the Turkish
            Effendi with success. I have got a good-sized cabin with good, clean divans round three
            sides for <name type="person" ref="#sally">Sally</name> and myself. <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> will sleep on deck and cook where he can. A poor Turkish lady is to
            inhabit a sort of dusthole by the side of my cabin; if she seems decent, I will
            entertain her hospitably. There is no furniture of any sort but the divan, and we cook
            our own food, bring our own candles, jugs, basins, beds and everything. If <name type="person" ref="#sally">Sally</name> and I were not such complete Arabs we should think it very
            miserable; but as things stand this year we say, _Alhamdulillah_ it is no worse! Luckily
            it is a very warm night, so we can make our arrangements unchilled. There is no door to
            the cabin, so we nail up an old plaid, and, as no one ever looks into a <foreign xml:lang="ar">hareem</foreign>, it is quite enough. All on board are Arabs—captain,
            engineer, and men. An English Sitt is a novelty, and the captain is unhappy that things
            are not _alla Franca_ for me. We are to tow three dahabiehs—M. Mounier’s, one belonging
            to the envoy from the Sultan of Darfour, and another. Three steamers were to have done
            it, but the Pasha had a fancy for all the boats, and so our poor little craft must do
            her best. Only fancy the Queen ordering all the river steamers up to Windsor! </p>
         <p> At <name type="place" ref="#minieh">Minieh</name> the Turkish General leaves us, and we
            shall have the boat to ourselves, so the captain has just been down to tell me. I should
            like to go with the gentlemen from Darfor, as you may suppose. See what strange
            combinations of people float on old Nile. Two Englishwomen, one French (Mme. Mounier),
            one Frenchman, Turks, Arabs, Negroes, Circassians, and men from Darfor, all in one
            party; perhaps the third boat contains some other strange element. The Turks are from
            Constantinople and can’t speak Arabic, and make faces at the muddy river water, which,
            indeed, I would rather have filtered. </p>
         <p> I hope to have letters from home to-morrow morning. Hassan, my faithful donkey-boy,
            will go to the post as soon as it is open and bring them down to <name type="place" ref="#boulak">Boulak</name>. Darling Rainie sent me a card with a cock robin for
            Christmas; how terribly I miss her dear little face and talk! I am pretty well now; I
            only feel rather weaker than before and more easily tired. I send you a kind letter of
            Mme. Tastu’s, who got her son to lend me the house at <name type="place" ref="#thebes">Thebes</name>.</p>
