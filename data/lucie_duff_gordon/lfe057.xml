         <p>DEAREST JANET, </p>
         <p> The weather has set in so horrid, as to dust, that I shall be glad to get away as soon
            as I can. If you have bought a dahabieh for me of course I will await its arrival. If
            not I will have two small boats from Keneh, whereby I shall avoid sticking in this very
            low water. Sheykh Hassan goes down in his boat in twenty days and urges me to travel
            under his escort, as of course the poor devils who are ‘out on their keeping’ after the
            Gau business have no means of living left but robbery, and Sheykh Hassan’s party is good
            for seven or eight guns. You will laugh at my listening to such a cowardly proposition
            (on my part) but my friends here are rather bent upon it, and Hassan is a capital
            fellow. If therefore the dahabieh is _in rerum naturæ_ and can start at once, well and
            good. </p>
         <p> _April_ 14.—The dahabieh sounds an excellent bargain to me and good for you also to get
            your people to Assouan first. Many thanks for the arrangement. </p>
         <p> Your version of our massacre is quite curious to us here. I know very intimately the
            Sheykh-el-Arab who helped to catch the poor people and also a young Turk who stood by
            while Fadil Pasha had the men laid down by ten at a time and chopped with pioneers’
            axes. My Turkish friend (a very good-humoured young fellow) quite admired the affair and
            expressed a desire to do likewise to all the fellaheen in Egypt. I have seen with my own
            eyes a second boatload of prisoners. I wish to God the Pasha knew the deep exasperation
            which his subordinates are causing. I do not like to say all I hear. As to the Ulema,
            Kadees, Muftis, etc., I know many from towns and villages, and all say ‘We are Muslims,
            but we should thank God to send Europeans to govern us,’ the feeling is against the
            Government and the Turks up here—not against Christians. A Coptic friend of mine has
            lost all his uncle’s family at Gau, all were shot down—Copt and Christian alike. As to
            Hajjee Sultan, who lies in chains at Keneh and his family up at Esneh, a better man
            never lived, nor one more liberal to Christians. Copts ate of his bread as freely as
            Muslims. He lies there because he is distantly related by marriage to Achmet et-Tayib,
            the real reason is because he is wealthy and some enemy covets his goods. </p>
         <p> Ask M. Mounier what he knows. Perhaps I know even more of the feeling as I am almost
            adopted by the Abu-l-Hajjajeeah, and sit every evening with some party or another of
            decent men. I assure you I am in despair at all I see—and if the soldiers do come it
            will be worse than the cattle disease. Are not the cawasses bad enough? Do they not buy
            in the market at their own prices and beat the sakkas in sole payment for the skins of
            water? Who denies it here? <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName> is like Paris,
            things are kept sweet there, but up here—! Of course Effendina hears the ‘smooth
            prophecies’ of the tyrants whom he sends up river. When I wrote before I knew nothing
            certain but now I have eye-witnesses’ testimony, and I say that the Pasha deceives or is
            deceived—I hope the latter. An order from him did stop the slaughter of women and
            children which Fadil Pasha was about to effect. </p>
         <p> To turn to less wretched matters. I will come right down Alexandria with the boat, I
            shall rejoice to see you again. </p>
         <p> Possibly the Abab’deh may come with me and I hope Sheykh Yussuf, ‘my chaplain’ as
            Arthur Taylor called him. We shall be quite a little fleet.</p>
