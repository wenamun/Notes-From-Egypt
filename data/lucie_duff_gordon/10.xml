         <p>My dear <name type="person" ref="#tom_taylor">Tom</name>,</p>

         <p>Your letter and <name type="person" ref="#laura">Laura</name>’s were a great pleasure to
            me in this distant land. I could not answer before, as I have been very ill. But
            Samaritans came with oil and wine and comforted me. It had an odd, dreary effect to hear
            my friend <name type="person" ref="#hekekian_bey">Hekekian Bey</name>, a learned old
            Armenian, and <name type="person" ref="#de_leo_bey">De Leo Bey</name>, my doctor,
            discoursing Turkish at my bedside, while my faithful <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> cried and prayed <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">Yah
                  Robbeena</foreign></hi>! <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">Yah
                  Saatir</foreign></hi>! (O Lord! O Preserver!) ‘don’t let her die.’</p>

         <p><name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name> is quite right that I am in love with the
            Arabs’ ways, and I have contrived to see and know more of family life than many
            Europeans who have lived here for years. When the Arabs feel that one really cares for
            them, they heartily return it. If I could only speak the language I could see anything.
               <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name>
            <hi rendition="italic">is</hi> the Arabian Nights; there is a little Frankish varnish
            here and there, but the government, the people—all is unchanged since that most
            veracious book was written. No words can describe the departure of the holy Mahmal and
            the pilgrims for <name type="place" ref="#mecca">Mecca</name>. I spent half the day
            loitering about in the Bedaween tents admiring the glorious, free people. To see a
            Bedaween and his wife walk through the streets of <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name> is superb. Her hand resting on his shoulder, and scarcely deigning to
            cover her haughty face, she looks down on the Egyptian veiled woman who carries the
            heavy burden and walks behind her lord and master.</p>

         <p>By no deed of my own have I become a slave-owner. The American Consul-General turned
            over to me a black girl of eight or nine, and in consequence of her reports the poor
            little black boy who is the slave and marmiton of the cook here has been entreating
               <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> to beg me to buy him and take him with
            me. It is touching to see the two poor little black things recounting their woes and
            comparing notes. I went yesterday to deposit my cooking things and boat furniture at my
            washerwoman’s house. Seeing me arrive on my donkey, followed by a cargo of household
            goods, about eight or ten Arab women thronged round delighted at the idea that I was
            coming to live in their quarter, and offering me neighbourly services. Of course all
            rushed upstairs, and my old washerwoman was put to great expense in pipes and coffee. I
            think, as you, that I must have the ‘black drop,’ and that the Arabs see it, for I am
            always told that I am like them, with praises of my former good looks. ‘You were
            beautiful <foreign xml:lang="ar">Hareem</foreign> once.’ Nothing is more striking to me
            than the way in which one is constantly reminded of <name type="person" ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</name>. The Christianity and the Islam of this country are full of the
            ancient worship, and the sacred animals have all taken service with Muslim saints. At
               <name type="place" ref="#minieh">Minieh</name> one reigns over crocodiles; higher up
            I saw the hole of Æsculapius’ serpent at <name type="place" ref="#gebel_sheykh_hereedee">Gebel Sheykh Hereedee</name>, and I fed the birds—as did <name type="person" ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</name>—who used to tear the cordage of boats which refused
            to feed them, and who are now the servants of Sheykh Naooneh, and still come on board by
            scores for the bread which no <name type="person" ref="#reis">Reis</name> dares refuse
            them. <name type="place" ref="#bubastis">Bubastis</name>’ cats are still fed in the
            Cadi’s court at public expense in <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name>, and
            behave with singular decorum when ‘the servant of the cats’ serves them their dinner.
            Among gods, <name type="person" ref="#amun_ra">Amun Ra</name>, the sun-god and
            serpent-killer, calls himself <name type="person" ref="st_george">Mar Girgis (St.
               George)</name> , and is worshipped by Christians and Muslims in the same churches,
            and <name type="person" ref="#osiris">Osiris</name> holds his festivals as riotously as
            ever at <name type="place" ref="#tanta">Tanta</name> in the <name type="place" ref="#delta">Delta</name>, under the name of Seyd el Bedawee. The <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">fellah</foreign></hi> women offer
            sacrifices to the Nile, and walk round ancient statues in order to have children. The
            ceremonies at births and burials are not Muslim, but ancient Egyptian.</p>

         <p>The Copts are far more close and reserved and backward than the Arabs, and they have
            been so repudiated by Europeans that they are doubly shy of us. The Europeans resent
            being called ‘Nazranee’ as a genteel Hebrew gentleman may shrink from ‘Jew.’ But I said
            boldly, ‘<hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">Ana Nazraneeh</foreign></hi>. <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">Alhamdulillah</foreign></hi>!’ (I am a
            Nazranee. Praise be to God), and found that it was much approved by the Muslims as well
            as the Copts. Curious things are to be seen here in religion—Muslims praying at the tomb
            of Mar Girgis (St. George) and the resting-places of Sittina Mariam and Seyidna Issa,
            and miracles, brand-new, of an equally mixed description.</p>

         <p>If you have any power over any artists, send them to paint here. No words can describe
            either the picturesque beauty of <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name> or the
            splendid forms of the people in Upper Egypt, and above all in <name type="place" ref="#nubia">Nubia</name>. I was in raptures at seeing how superb an animal man (and
            woman) really is. My donkey-girl at <name type="place" ref="#thebes">Thebes</name>,
            dressed like a Greek statue—Ward es-Sham (the Rose of Syria)—was a feast to the eyes;
            and here, too, what grace and sweetness, and how good is a drink of Nile water out of an
            amphora held to your lips by a woman as graceful as she is kindly. ‘May it benefit
            thee,’ she says, smiling with all her beautiful teeth and eyes. ‘<hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">Alhamdulillah</foreign></hi>,’ you reply; and it is worth
            thanking God for. The days of the beauty of <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name>
            are numbered. The mosques are falling to decay, the exquisite lattice windows rotting
            away and replaced by European glass and jalousies. Only the people and the Government
            remain unchanged. Read all the pretty paragraphs about civilisation here, and then say,
            Bosh!</p>

         <p>If you know anyone coming here and wanting a good servant and dragoman, recommend my
            dear <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar Abou el-Haláweh</name> of <name type="place" ref="#alexandria">Alexandria </name>. He has been my friend and companion, as well as
            my cook and general servant, now for six months, and we are very sad at our approaching
            separation. I am to spend a day in his house with his young wife at <name type="place" ref="#alexandria">Alexandria</name>, and to eat his bread. He sadly wants to go with
            me to Europe and to see my children. <name type="person" ref="#sally">Sally</name>, I think, is
            almost as fond of the Arabs as I am, and very popular. My poor ragged crew were for ever
            calling out ‘Yah Sara’ for some assistance or other, hurt fingers or such calamities;
            and the quantity of doctoring I did was fearful. <name type="person" ref="#sally">Sally</name> was
            constantly wishing for you to see all manner of things and to sketch. What a yarn I have
            made!</p>
