         <p>Dearest <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>, </p>
         <p> We are just arriving at <name type="place" ref="#minieh">Minieh</name> whence the
            railway will take letters quickly. We dined at <name type="place" ref="#kenneh">Keneh</name> and at <name type="place" ref="#siout">Siout</name> with some friends,
            and had fantasia at <name type="place" ref="#kenneh">Keneh</name>. <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> desires his dutiful salaams to you and hopes you will be
            satisfied with the care he has taken of ‘the child.’ How you would have been amused to
            hear the girl who came to dance for us at <name type="place" ref="#esneh">Esneh</name>
            lecture <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name> about evil ways, but she was
            an old friend of mine, and gave good and sound advice. </p>
         <p> Everyone is delighted about Abyssinia. ‘Thank God our Pasha will fear the English more
            than before, and the Sultan also,’ and when I lamented the expense, they all exclaimed,
            ‘Never mind the expense, it is worth more than ten millions to you; your faces are
            whitened and your power enlarged before all the world; but why don’t you take us on your
            way back.’ </p>
         <p> I saw a very interesting man at <name type="place" ref="#kenneh">Keneh</name>, one
            Faam, a Copt, who has turned Presbyterian, and has induced a hundred others at Koos to
            do likewise: an American missionary is their minister. Faam was sent off to the Soudan
            by the Patriarch, but brought back. He is a splendid old fellow, and I felt I looked on
            the face of a Christian martyr, a curious sight in the nineteenth century: the calm,
            fearless, rapt expression was like what you see in noble old Italian pictures, and he
            had the perfect absence of ‘doing pious’ which shows the undoubting faith. He and the
            Mufti, also a noble fellow, sparred about religion in a jocose and friendly tone which
            would be quite unintelligible in Exeter Hall. When he was gone the Mufti said, ‘Ah! we
            thank them, for though they know not the truth of Islam, they are good men, and walk
            straight, and would die for their religion: their example is excellent; praise be to God
            for them.’</p>
