         <p>Dearest <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>, </p>
         <p> I have been too weak to write, but the heat set in three days ago and took away my
            cough, and I feel much better. <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name> also
            flourishes in the broil, and protests against moving yet. He speaks a good deal of
            Arabic and is friends with everyone. It is _Salaam aleykoum ya maris_ on all sides. A
            Belgian has died here, and his two slaves, a very nice black boy and an Abyssinian girl,
            got my little varlet, Darfour, to coax me to take them under my protection, which I have
            done, as there appeared a strong probability that they would be ‘annexed’ by a rascally
            Copt who is a Consular agent at <name type="place" ref="#kenneh">Keneh</name>. I believe
            the Belgian has left money for them, which of course they would never get without
            someone to look after it, and so I have Ramadan, the boy, with me, and shall take the
            girl when I go, and carry them both to <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name>,
            settle their little business, and let them present a sealed-up book which they have to
            their Consul there, according to their master’s desire, and then marry the girl to some
            decent man. I have left her in Mustapha’s <foreign xml:lang="ar">hareem</foreign> till I
            go. </p>
         <p> I enjoyed Nubia immensely, and long to go and live with the descendants of a great
            _Ras_ (head, chief,) who entertained me at Ibreem, and who said, like Ravenswood, ‘Thou
            art come to a fallen house, and there is none to serve thee left save me.’ It was a
            paradise of a place, and the Nubian had the grand manners of a very old, proud nobleman.
            I had a letter to him from Sheykh Yussuf. </p>
         <p> Since I wrote the above it has turned quite chilly again, so we agreed to stay till the
            heat really begins. <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name> is so charmed with
            Luxor that he does not want to go, and we mean to let the boat and live here next
            winter. I think another week will see us start down stream. <name type="person" ref="#janet">Janet</name> talks of coming up the Nile with me next year, which would
            be pleasant. I am a little better than I have been the last two months. I was best in
            Nubia but I got a cold at <name type="place" ref="#esneh">Esneh</name>, second hand from
               <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name>, which made me very seedy. I cannot
            go about at all for want of breath. Could you send me a chair such as people are carried
            in by two men? A common chair is awkward for the men when the banks are steep, and I am
            nervous, so I never go out. I wish you could see your son bare-legged and footed, in a
            shirt and a pair of white Arab drawers, rushing about with the fellaheen. He is
            everybody’s ‘brother’ or ‘son.’</p>
