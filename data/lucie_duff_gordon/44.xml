         <p>Dearest <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>, </p>
         <p> I have not written for a long time because I have had a fever. Now I am all right
            again, only weak. If you can come please bring the books in enclosed list for an
            American Egyptologist at Luxor—a friend of mine. My best love to <name type="person" ref="#janet">Janet</name> and my other chicks. I wish I could see my <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name>. Tell <name type="person" ref="#janet">Janet</name> that Hassan donkey boy, has married a girl of eleven, and Phillips that
            Hassan remembers him quite tenderly and is very proud of having had his ‘face’ drawn by
            him, ‘certainly he was of the friends if not a brother of the Sitt, he so loved the
            things of the Arabs.’ I went to the <foreign xml:lang="ar">Hareem</foreign> _soirée_ at
            Hassan’s before the wedding—at that event I was ill. My good doctor was up the river,
            and <name type="person" ref="#hekekian_bey">Hekekian Bey</name> is in Italy, so I am
            very lonely here. The weather is bad, so very damp; I stream with perspiration more than
            in June at Luxor, and I don’t like civilization so very much. It keeps me awake at night
            in the grog shops and rings horrid bells and fights and quarrels in the street, and
            disturbs my Muslim nerves till I utter such epithets as _kelb_ (dog) and _khanseer_
            (pig) against the Frangi, and wish I were in a ‘beastly Arab’ quarter.</p>
