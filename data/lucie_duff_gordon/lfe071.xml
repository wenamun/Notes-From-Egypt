         <p>DEAREST JANET, </p>
         <p> I received your letter of the 4th inst. yesterday. I am much distressed not to hear a
            better account of you. Why don’t you go to <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName> for
            a time? Your experience of your German confirms me (if I needed it) in my resolution to
            have no more Europeans unless I should find one ‘seasoned.’ The nuisance is too great. I
            shall borrow a neighbour’s slave for my stay here and take some one in <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName>. My dress will do very well in native hands. </p>
         <p> I am at last getting really better again, I hope. We have had a cold winter, but not
            trying. There has not been much wind, and the weather has been very steady and clear. I
            wish I had Palgrave’s book. Hajjee Ali was to bring up my box, but it had not arrived
            when he sailed. I will send down the old saddle whenever I can find a safe opportunity
            and have received the other. </p>
         <p> Many thanks for all the various detachments of newspapers, which were a great solace. I
            wish you would give me your photo—large size—to hang up with Rainie and Maurice here and
            in the boat. Like the small one you gave me at Soden, you said you had some copies big. </p>
         <p> My doctoring business has become quite formidable. I should like to sell my practice to
            any ‘rising young surgeon.’ It brings in a very fair income of vegetables, eggs, turkeys
            pigeons, etc. </p>
         <p> How is the Shereef of Mecca’s horse? I ambition to ride that holy animal.</p>
