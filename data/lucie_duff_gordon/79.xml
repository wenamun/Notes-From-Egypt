         <p>MAURICE MY DARLING, </p>
         <p> I send you a Roman coin which a man gave me as a fee for medical attendance. I hope you
            will like it for your watch-chain. I made our Coptic goldsmith bore a hole in it. Why
            don’t you write to me, you young rascal? I am now living in my boat, and I often wish
            for you here to donkey ride about with me. I can’t write you a proper letter now as
               <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> is waiting to take this up to Mr.
            Palgrave with the drawings for your father. <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name>
            desires his best salaam to you and to Rainie, and is very much disappointed that you are
            not coming out in the winter to go up to Luxor. We had a hurricane coming down the Nile,
            and a boat behind us sank. We only lost an anchor, and had to wait and have it fished up
            by the fishermen of a neighbouring village. In places the water was so shallow that the
            men had to push the boat over by main force, and all went into the river. The captain
            and I shouted out, _Islam el Islam_, equivalent to, ‘Heave away, boys.’ There are
            splendid illuminations about to take place here, because the Pasha has got leave to make
            his youngest boy his successor, and people are ordered to rejoice, which they do with
            much grumbling—it will cost something enormous.</p>
