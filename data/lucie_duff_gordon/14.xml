         <p>Dearest <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>,</p>

         <p>I have spun such a yarn to my mother that I shall make it serve for both. It may amuse
            you to see what impression <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name> makes. I ride
            along on my valiant donkey led by the stalwart <name type="person" ref="#hassan">Hassan</name> and
            attended by <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name>, and constantly say, ‘Oh, if our
            master were here, how pleased he would be’—husband is not a correct word.</p>

         <p>I went out to the tombs yesterday. Fancy that <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> witnessed the destruction of some sixty-eight or so of the most
            exquisite buildings—the tombs and mosques of the Arab Khaleefehs, which <name type="person" ref="#said_pasha">Said Pasha</name> used to divert himself with
            bombarding for practice for his artillery. <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name>
            was then in the boy corps of camel artillery, now disbanded. Thus the Pasha added the
            piquancy of sacrilege to barbarity.</p>

         <p>The street and the neighbours would divert you. Opposite lives a Christian dyer who must
            be a seventh brother of the admirable barber. The same impertinence, loquacity, and love
            of meddling in everybody’s business. I long to see him thrashed, though he is a constant
            comedy. My delightful servant, <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar
               Abou-el-Halláweh</name> (the father of sweets)—his family are pastrycooks—is the type
            of all the amiable <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="fr">jeune
                  premiers</foreign></hi> of the stories. I am privately of opinion that he is
            Bedr-ed-Deen Hassan, the more that he can make cream tarts and there is no pepper in
            them. Cream tarts are not very good, but lamb stuffed with pistachio nuts fulfils all
            one’s dreams of excellence. The Arabs next door and the Levantines opposite are quiet
            enough, but how <hi rendition="italic">do</hi> they eat all the cucumbers they buy of
            the man who cries them every morning as ‘fruit gathered by sweet girls in the garden
            with the early dew.’</p>

         <p>The more I see of the back-slums of <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name>, the
            more in love I am with it. The oldest European towns are tame and regular in comparison,
            and the people are so pleasant. If you smile at anything that amuses you, you get the
            kindest, brightest smiles in return; they give hospitality with their faces, and if one
            brings out a few words, ‘Mashallah! what Arabic the Sitt Ingleez speaks.’ The Arabs are
            clever enough to understand the amusement of a stranger and to enter into it, and are
            amused in turn, and they are wonderfully unprejudiced. When <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> explains to me their views on various matters, he adds: ‘The
            Arab people think so—I know not if right;’ and the way in which the Arab merchants
            worked the electric telegraph, and the eagerness of the Fellaheen for steam-ploughs, are
            quite extraordinary. They are extremely clever and nice children, easily amused, easily
            roused into a fury which lasts five minutes and leaves no malice, and half the lying and
            cheating of which they are accused comes from misunderstanding and ignorance. When I
            first took <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> he was by way of ‘ten pounds,
            twenty pounds,’ being nothing for my dignity. But as soon as I told him that ‘my master
            was a Bey who got £100 a month and no backsheesh,’ he was as careful as if for himself.
            They see us come here and do what only their greatest Pashas do, hire a boat to
            ourselves, and, of course, think our wealth is boundless. The lying is mostly from
            fright. They dare not suggest a difference of opinion to a European, and lie to get out
            of scrapes which blind obedience has often got them into. As to the charges of
            shopkeepers, that is the custom, and the haggling a ceremony you must submit to. It is
            for the purchaser or employer to offer a price and fix wages—the reverse of Europe—and
            if you ask the price they ask something fabulous at random.</p>

         <p>I hope to go home next month, as soon as it gets too hot here and is likely to be warm
            enough in England. I do so long to see the children again.</p>
