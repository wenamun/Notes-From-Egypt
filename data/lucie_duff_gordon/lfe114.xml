         <p>DEAREST ALICK, </p>
         <p> Your letter of the 10 December most luckily came on to Edfoo by the American
            Consul-General, who overtook us there in his steamer and gave me a lunch. Maurice was as
            usual up to his knees in a distant swamp trying to shoot wild geese. Now we are up close
            to Assouan, and there are no more marshes; but _en revanche_ there are quails and
            _kata_, the beautiful little sand grouse. I eat all that Maurice shoots, which I find
            very good for me; and as for Maurice he has got back his old round boyish face; he eats
            like an ogre, walks all day, sleeps like a top, bathes in the morning and has laid on
            flesh so that his clothes won’t button. At Esneh we fell in with handsome Hassan, who is
            now Sheykh of the Abab’deh, as his elder brother died. He gave us a letter to his
            brother at Syaleh, up in Nubia; ordering him to get up a gazelle hunt for Maurice, and I
            am to visit his wife. I think it will be pleasant, as the Bedaween women don’t veil or
            shut up, and to judge by the men ought to be very handsome. Both Hassan and Abu Goord,
            who was with him, preached the same sermon as my learned friend Abdurrachman had done at
            Luxor. ‘Why, in God’s name, I left my son without a wife?’ They are sincerely shocked at
            such indifference to a son’s happiness. </p>
         <p> ASSOUAN, 10 _Ramadan_. </p>
         <p> I have no almanach, but you will be able to know the date by your own red pocketbook,
            which determined the beginning of Ramadan at Luxor this year. They received a telegram
            fixing it for Thursday, but Sheykh Yussuf said that he was sure the astronomers in
            London knew best, and made it Friday. To-morrow we shall make our bargain, and next day
            go up the Cataract—Inshallah, in safety. The water is very good, as Jesus the black
            pilot tells me. He goes to the second Cataract and back, as I intend to stay nearly two
            months in Nubia. The weather here is perfect now, we have been lucky in having a lovely
            mild winter hitherto. We are very comfortable with a capital crew, who are all devoted
            to Maurice. The Sheykh of the Abab’deh has promised to join us if he can, when he has
            convoyed some 400 Bashibazouks up to Wady Halfa, who are being sent up because the
            English are in Abyssinia.</p>
