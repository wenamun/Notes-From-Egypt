         <p>Dearest <foreign xml:lang="de"><name type="person" ref="#sarah_austin">Mutter</name></foreign>,</p>

         <p>I came here on <date>Saturday</date> night. To-day is <date>Wednesday</date>, and I am
            already much better. I have attached an excellent donkey and his master, a delightful
            youth called <name type="person" ref="#hassan">Hassan</name>, to my household for fifteen piastres
            (under two shillings) a day. They live at the door, and <name type="person" ref="#hassan">Hassan</name> cleans the stairs and goes errands during the heat of the day, and I
            ride out very early, at six or seven, and again at five. The air is delicious now. It is
            very hot for a few hours, but not stifling, and the breeze does not chill one as it does
            at <name type="place" ref="#alexandria">Alexandria</name>. I live all day and all night
            with open windows, and plenty of fresh warm air is the best of remedies. I can do no
            better than stay here till the heat becomes too great. I left little <name type="person" ref="#zeyneb">Zeyneb</name> at <name type="place" ref="#alexandria">Alexandria
            </name> with <name type="person" ref="#janet">Janet</name>’s maid <name type="person" ref="#ellen">Ellen</name> who quite loves her, and begged to keep her ‘for company,’
            and also to help in their removal to the new house. She clung about me and made me
            promise to come back to her, but was content to stop with <name type="person" ref="#ellen">Ellen</name>, whose affection she of course returns. It was pleasant to
            see her so happy, and how she relished being ‘put to bed’ with a kiss by <name type="person" ref="#ellen">Ellen</name> or <name type="person" ref="#sally">Sally</name>. Her
            Turkish master, whom she pronounces to have been <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">batal</foreign></hi> (bad), called her <name type="person" ref="#zeyneb">Salaam es-Sidi</name> (the Peace of her Master); but she said that in
            her own village she used to be <name type="person" ref="#zeyneb">Zeyneb</name>, and so
            we call her. She has grown fatter and, if possible, blacker. <name type="person" ref="#Mahbrooka">Mahbrooka</name> (Good Fortune), the elder wife of <name type="person" ref="#hegab">Hegab</name>, the confectioner, was much interested in
            her, as her fate had been the same. She was bought by an Italian who lived with her till
            his death, when she married <name type="person" ref="#hegab">Hegab</name>. She is a
            pious Muslimeh, and invoked the intercession of Seyidna Mohammad for me when I told her
            I had no intention of baptizing <name type="person" ref="#zeyneb">Zeyneb</name> by
            force, as had been done to her.</p>

         <p>The fault of my lodging here is the noise. We are on the road from the railway and there
            is no quiet except in the few hot hours, when nothing is heard but the cool tinkle of
            the Sakka’s brass cup as he sells water in the street, or perchance <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">erksoos</foreign></hi> (liquorice-water),
            or caroub or raisin sherbet. The <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">erksoos</foreign></hi> is rather bitter and very good. I drink it a good deal,
            for drink one must; a <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">gulleh</foreign></hi> of water is soon gone. A gulleh is a wide-mouthed porous jar,
            and Nile water drunk out of it without the intervention of a glass is delicious. <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> goes to market every morning with a donkey—I
            went too, and was much amused—and cooks, and in the evening goes out with me if I want
            him. I told him I had recommended him highly, and hoped he would get good employment;
            but he declares that he will go with no one else so long as I come to Egypt, whatever
            the difference of wages may be. ‘The bread I eat with you is sweet’—a pretty little
            unconscious antithesis to <name type="person" ref="#dante">Dante</name>. I have been
            advising his brother <name type="person" ref="#hajjee_ali">Hajjee Ali</name> to start a
            hotel at <name type="place" ref="#thebes">Thebes</name> for invalids, and he has already
            set about getting a house there; there is <hi rendition="italic">one</hi>. Next winter
            there will be steamers twice a week—to <name type="place" ref="#assouan">Assouan</name>!
               <name type="person" ref="#juvenal">Juvenal</name>’s distant <name type="place" ref="#assouan">Syene</name>, where he died in banishment. My old washerwoman sent me
            a fervent entreaty through <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> that I would dine
            with her one day, since I had made <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name>
            delightful with my presence. If one will only devour these people’s food, they are
            enchanted; they like that much better than a present. So I will honour her house some
            day. Good old <name type="person" ref="#hannah">Hannah</name>, she is divorced for being
            too fat and old, and replaced by a young Turk whose family sponge on <name type="person" ref="hajjee_ali">Hajjee Ali</name> and are condescending. If I could afford it, I
            would have a sketch of a beloved old mosque of mine, falling to decay, and with three
            palm-trees growing in the middle of it. Indeed, I would have a book full, for all is
            exquisite, and alas, all is going. The old Copt quarter is <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="fr">entamé</foreign></hi>, and hideous, shabby French houses,
            like the one I live in, are being run up; and in this weather how much better would be
            the Arab courtyard, with its mastabah and fountain!</p>

         <p> There is a quarrel now in the street; how they talk and gesticulate, and everybody puts
            in a word; a boy has upset a cake-seller’s tray, ‘<hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">Naal Abu’k</foreign></hi>!’ (Curses on your father) he claims six
            piastres damages, and everyone gives an opinion <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="fr">pour ou contre</foreign></hi>. We all look out of the window; my
            opposite neighbour, the pretty Armenian woman, leans out, and her diamond head-ornaments
            and earrings glitter as she laughs like a child. The Christian dyer is also very active
            in the row, which, like all Arab rows, ends in nothing; it evaporates in fine theatrical
            gestures and lots of talk. Curious! In the street they are so noisy, but get the same
            men in a coffee-shop or anywhere, and they are the quietest of mankind. Only one man
            speaks at a time, the rest listen, and never interrupt; twenty men don’t make the noise
            of three Europeans.</p>

         <p><name type="person" ref="#hekekian_bey">Hekekian Bey</name> is my near neighbour, and he
            comes in and we <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="fr">fronder</foreign></hi> the
            Government. His heart is sore with disinterested grief for the sufferings of the people.
            ‘Don’t they deserve to be decently governed, to be allowed a little happiness and
            prosperity? They are so docile, so contented; are they not a good people?’ Those were
            his words as he was recounting some new iniquity. Of course half these acts are done
            under pretext of improving and civilizing, and the Europeans applaud and say, ‘Oh, but
            nothing could be done without forced labour,’ and the poor Fellaheen are marched off in
            gangs like convicts, and their families starve, and (who’d have thought it) the
            population keeps diminishing. No wonder the cry is, ‘Let the English Queen come and take
            us.’ You see, I don’t see things quite as <name type="person" ref="#ross">Ross</name>
            does, but mine is another <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">standpunkt</foreign></hi>, and my heart is with the Arabs. I care less about
            opening up the trade with the Soudan and all the new railways, and I should like to see
            person and property safe, which no one’s is here (Europeans, of course, excepted). <name type="person" ref="#ismail_pasha">Ismail Pasha</name> got the Sultan to allow him to
            take 90,000 feddans of uncultivated land for himself as private property, very well, but
            the late Viceroy Said granted eight years ago certain uncultivated lands to a good many
            Turks, his <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="fr">employés</foreign></hi>, in
            hopes of founding a landed aristocracy and inducing them to spend their capital in
            cultivation. They did so, and now <name type="person" ref="#ismail_pasha">Ismail
               Pasha</name> takes their improved land and gives them feddan for feddan of his new
            land, which will take five years to bring into cultivation, instead. He forces them to
            sign a <hi rendition="italic">voluntary</hi> deed of exchange, or they go off to <name type="place" ref="#fazogloo">Fazogloo</name>, a hot Siberia whence none return. The
            Sultan also left a large sum of money for religious institutions and charities—Muslim,
            Jew, and Christian. None have received a foddah. It is true the Sultan and his suite
            plundered the Pasha and the people here; but from all I hear the Sultan really wishes to
            do good. What is wanted here is hands to till the ground, and wages are very high; food,
            of course, gets dearer, and the forced labour inflicts more suffering than before, and
            the population will decrease yet faster. This appears to me to be a state of things in
            which it is no use to say that public works must be made at any cost. The wealth will
            perhaps be increased, if meanwhile the people are not exterminated. Then, every new
            Pasha builds a huge new palace while those of his predecessors fall to ruin. <name type="person" ref="#mehemet_ali">Mehemet Ali</name>’s sons even cut down the trees of
            his beautiful botanical garden and planted beans there; so money is constantly wasted
            more than if it were thrown into the Nile, for then the Fellaheen would not have to
            spend their time, so much wanted for agriculture, in building hideous barrack-like
            so-called palaces. What chokes me is to hear English people talk of the stick being ‘the
            only way to manage Arabs’ as if anyone could doubt that it is the easiest way to manage
            any people where it can be used with impunity.</p>

         <p><hi rendition="italic"><date>Sunday</date></hi>.—I went to a large unfinished new Coptic
            church this morning. <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> went with me up to the
            women’s gallery, and was discreetly going back when he saw me in the right place, but
            the Coptic women began to talk to him and asked questions about me all the time I was
            looking down on the strange scene below. I believe they celebrate the ancient mysteries
            still. The clashing of cymbals, the chanting, a humming unlike any sound I ever heard,
            the strange yellow copes covered with stranger devices—it was <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">wunderlich</foreign></hi>. At the end everyone went away,
            and I went down and took off my shoes to go and look at the church. While I was doing so
            a side-door opened and a procession entered. A priest dressed in the usual black robe
            and turban of all Copts carrying a trident-shaped sort of candlestick, another with
            cymbals, a lot of little boys, and two young ecclesiastics of some sort in the yellow
            satin copes (contrasting queerly with the familiar tarboosh of common life on their
            heads), these carried little babies and huge wax tapers, each a baby and a taper. They
            marched round and round three times, the cymbals going furiously, and chanting a jig
            tune. The dear little tiny boys marched just in front of the priest with such a pretty
            little solemn, consequential air. Then they all stopped in front of the sanctuary, and
            the priest untied a sort of broad-coloured tape which was round each of the babies,
            reciting something in Coptic all the time, and finally touched their foreheads and hands
            with water. This is a ceremony subsequent to baptism after I don’t know how many days,
            but the priest ties and then unties the bands. Of what is this symbolical? <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="fr">Je m’y perds</foreign></hi>. Then an old
            man gave a little round cake of bread, with a cabalistic-looking pattern on it, both to
               <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> and to me, which was certainly baked for
               <name type="person" ref="#isis">Isis</name>. A lot of closely-veiled women stood on
            one side in the aisle, and among them the mothers of the babies who received them from
            the men in yellow copes at the end of the ceremony. One of these young men was very
            handsome, and as he stood looking down and smiling on the baby he held, with the light
            of the torch sharpening the lines of his features, would have made a lovely picture. The
            expression was sweeter than St. Vincent de Paul, because his smile told that he could
            have played with the baby as well as have prayed for it. In this country one gets to see
            how much more beautiful a perfectly natural expression is than any degree of the
            mystical expression of the best painters, and it is so refreshing that no one tries to
            look pious. The Muslim looks serious, and often warlike, as he stands at prayer. The
            Christian just keeps his everyday face. When the Muslim gets into a state of devotional
            frenzy he does not think of making a face, and it is quite tremendous. I don’t think the
            Copt has any such ardours, but the scene this morning was all the more touching that no
            one was ‘behaving him or herself’ at all. A little acolyte peeped into the sacramental
            cup and swigged off the drops left in it with the most innocent air, and no one rebuked
            him, and the quite little children ran about in the sanctuary—up to seven they are
            privileged—and only they and the priests enter it. It is a pretty commentary on the
            words ‘Suffer the little children,’ etc.</p>

         <p>I am more and more annoyed at not being able to ask questions for myself, as I don’t
            like to ask through a Muslim and no Copts speak any foreign language, or very very few.
               <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> and <name type="person" ref="#hassan">Hassan</name> had
            been at five this morning to the tomb of Sittina Zeyneb, one of the daughters of the
            Prophet, to ‘see her’ (Sunday is her day of reception), and say the Fathah at her tomb.
            Next Friday the great <foreign xml:lang="ar">Bairam</foreign> begins and every Muslim
            eats a bit of meat at his richer neighbour’s expense. It is the day on which the
            pilgrims go up the sacred mount near <name type="place" ref="#mecca">Mecca</name>, to
            hear the sermon which terminates the Haj. Yesterday I went to call on pretty Mrs. <name type="person" ref="#wilkinson">Wilkinson</name>, she is an Armenian of the Greek
            faith, and was gone to pray at the convent of <name type="person" ref="#st_george">Mar
               Girgis</name> (<name type="person" ref="#st_george">St. George</name>) to cure the
            pains a bad rheumatic fever has left in her hands. Evidently <name type="person" ref="#st_george">Mar Girgis</name> is simply <name type="person" ref="#ammon_ra">Ammon Ra</name>, the God of the Sun and great serpent-slayer, who is still revered
            in Egypt by all sects, and <name type="person" ref="#seyd_el_bedawee">Seyd
               el-Bedawee</name> is as certainly one form of <name type="person" ref="#osiris">Osiris</name>. His festivals, held twice a year at <name type="place" ref="#tanta">Tanta</name>, still display the symbol of the Creator of all things. All is thus
            here—the women wail the dead, as on the old sculptures, all the ceremonies are pagan,
            and would shock an Indian Mussulman as much as his objection to eat with a Christian
            shocks an Arab. This country is a palimpsest, in which the Bible is written over <name type="person" ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</name>, and the Koran over that. In the
            towns the Koran is most visible, in the country <name type="person" ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</name>. I fancy it is most marked and most curious among the Copts, whose
            churches are shaped like the ancient temples, but they are so much less accessible than
            the Arabs that I know less of their customs.</p>

         <p>Now I have filled such a long letter I hardly know if it is worth sending, and whether
            you will be amused by my commonplaces of Eastern life. I kill a sheep next Friday, and
               <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> will cook a stupendous dish for the poor
            Fellaheen who are lying about the railway-station, waiting to be taken to work
            somewhere. That is to be my <foreign xml:lang="ar">Bairam</foreign>, and <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> hopes for great benefit for me from the
            process.</p>
