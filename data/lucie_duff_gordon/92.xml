         <p>Dearest <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>, </p>
         <p> Only two days ago I received letters from you of the 17 September and the 19 November.
            I wonder how many get lost and where? <name type="person" ref="#janet">Janet</name>
            gives me hopes of a visit of a few days in March and promises me a little terrier dog,
            whereat <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> is in raptures. I have made no plans
            at all, never having felt well enough to hope to be able to travel. The weather has
            changed for the better, and it is not at all old now; we shall see what the warmth does
            for me. You make my bowels yearn with your account of Rainie. If only we had Prince
            Achmet’s carpet, and you could all come here for a few months. </p>
         <p> We were greatly excited here last week; a boy was shot out in the sugar-cane field: he
            was with four Copts, and at first it looked ugly for the Copts. But the Maōhn tells me
            he is convinced they are innocent, and that they only prevaricated from fear—it was
            robbers shot the poor child. What struck and surprised me in the affair was the
            excessive horror and consternation it produced; the Maōhn had not had a murder in his
            district at all in eight years. The market-place was thronged with wailing women, <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> was sick all day, and the Maōhn pale and
            wretched. The horror of killing seems greater here than ever I saw it. Palgrave says the
            same of the Arabian Arabs in his book: it is not one’s notion of Oriental feeling, but a
            murder in England is taken quite as a joke compared with the scene here. I fear there
            will be robberies, owing to the distress, and the numbers who are running away from the
            land unable to pay their taxes. Don’t fear for me, for I have two watchmen in the house
            every night—the regular guard and an amateur, a man whose boy I took down to <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name> to study in Gama’l Azhar. </p>
         <p> Palgrave has written to <name type="person" ref="#ross">Ross</name> wanting Mabrook
            back. I am very sorry, the more so as Mabrook is recalcitrant. ‘I want to stay with
            thee, I don’t want to go back to the Nazarene.’ A boy who heard him said, ‘but the Lady
            is a Nazarene too;’ whereupon Mabrook slapped his face with great vigour. He will be
            troublesome if he does turn restive, and he is one who can only be managed by kindness.
            He is as good and quiet as possible with us, but the stubborn will is there and he is
            too ignorant to be reasoned with. </p>
         <p> _January_ 14.—To-day the four Copts have again changed their story, and after swearing
            that the robbers were strangers, have accused a man who has shot birds for me all this
            winter: and the poor devil is gone to <name type="place" ref="#kenneh">Keneh</name> in
            chains. The weather seems to have set in steadily for fine. I hope soon to get out, but
            my donkey has grown old and shaky and I am too weak to walk, so I sit in the
            balcony.</p>
