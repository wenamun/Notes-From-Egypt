         <p>Dearest <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>, </p>
         <p> I will go down to <name type="place" ref="#alexandria">Alexandria </name> in the boat
            and <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> will work at her. She wants a great deal
            of repairing I find, and his superintendence will save much money—besides he will do one
            man’s work as he is a much better carpenter than most here having learnt of the English
            workmen on the railroad—but the <name type="person" ref="#reis">Reis</name> says the
            boat must come out of the water as her bottom is unsound. She is a splendid sailer I
            hear and remarkably comfortable. The beds in the _kasneh_ would do for Jacob Omnium. So
            when you ‘honour our house’ you will be happy. The saloon is small, and the berths as
            usual. Also she is a very handsome shape—but she wants no end of repairs. So <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> is consoled at being left because he will ‘save
            our money’ a great deal by piecing sails, and cutting and contriving, and scraping and
            painting himself. Only he is afraid for me. However, _Allah Kereem_. </p>
         <p> I have a very good <name type="person" ref="#reis">Reis</name> I think. The usual tight
            little black fellow from near <name type="place" ref="#assouan">Assouan</name>—very neat
            and active and good tempered—the same cross steersman that we had up to Bedreshayn—but
            he knows his work well. We had contrary gales the whole way. My men worked all they
            possibly could, and pulled the rope all day and rowed all night, day after day—but we
            were twenty-eight days getting down. </p>
         <p> I can’t write any more.</p>
