         <p>Dearest <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>, </p>
         <p> Your letter of the 10 December most luckily came on to Edfoo by the American
            Consul-General, who overtook us there in his steamer and gave me a lunch. <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name> was as usual up to his knees in a distant
            swamp trying to shoot wild geese. Now we are up close to <name type="place" ref="#assouan">Assouan</name>, and there are no more marshes; but _en revanche_ there
            are quails and _kata_, the beautiful little sand grouse. I eat all that <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name> shoots, which I find very good for me;
            and as for <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name> he has got back his old
            round boyish face; he eats like an ogre, walks all day, sleeps like a top, bathes in the
            morning and has laid on flesh so that his clothes won’t button. At <name type="place" ref="#esneh">Esneh</name> we fell in with handsome Hassan, who is now Sheykh of the
            Abab’deh, as his elder brother died. He gave us a letter to his brother at Syaleh, up in
               <name type="place" ref="#nubia">Nubia</name>; ordering him to get up a gazelle hunt
            for <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name>, and I am to visit his wife. I
            think it will be pleasant, as the Bedaween women don’t veil or shut up, and to judge by
            the men ought to be very handsome. Both Hassan and Abu Goord, who was with him, preached
            the same sermon as my learned friend Abdurrachman had done at Luxor. ‘Why, in God’s
            name, I left my son without a wife?’ They are sincerely shocked at such indifference to
            a son’s happiness. </p>
         <p> ASSOUAN, 10 _Ramadan_. </p>
         <p> I have no almanach, but you will be able to know the date by your own red pocketbook,
            which determined the beginning of Ramadan at Luxor this year. They received a telegram
            fixing it for Thursday, but Sheykh Yussuf said that he was sure the astronomers in
            London knew best, and made it Friday. To-morrow we shall make our bargain, and next day
            go up the Cataract—Inshallah, in safety. The water is very good, as Jesus the black
            pilot tells me. He goes to the second Cataract and back, as I intend to stay nearly two
            months in <name type="place" ref="#nubia">Nubia</name>. The weather here is perfect now,
            we have been lucky in having a lovely mild winter hitherto. We are very comfortable with
            a capital crew, who are all devoted to <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name>. The Sheykh of the Abab’deh has promised to join us if he can, when he
            has convoyed some 400 Bashibazouks up to Wady Halfa, who are being sent up because the
            English are in Abyssinia.</p>
