         <p>DEAREST ALICK, </p>
         <p> We left <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName> last Sunday morning, and a wonderfully
            queer company we were. I had been promised all the steamer to myself, but owing to
            Ismail Pasha’s caprices our little steamer had to do the work of three—_i.e._, to carry
            passengers, to tow M. Mounier’s dahabieh, and to tow the oldest, dirtiest, queerest
            Nubian boat, in which the young son of the Sultan of Darfoor and the Sultan’s envoy, a
            handsome black of Dongola (not a negro), had visited Ismail Pasha. The best cabin was
            taken by a sulky old one-eyed Turkish Pasha, so I had the fore-cabin, luckily a large
            one, where I slept with Sally on one divan and I on the other, and Omar at my feet. He
            tried sleeping on deck, but the Pasha’s Arnouts were too bad company, and the captain
            begged me to ‘cover my face’ and let my servant sleep at my feet. Besides, there was a
            poor old asthmatic Turkish Effendi going to collect the taxes, and a lot of women in the
            engine-room, and children also. It would have been insupportable but for the hearty
            politeness of the Arab captain, a regular ‘old salt,’ and owing to his attention and
            care it was only very amusing. </p>
         <p> At Benisouef, the first town above <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName> (seventy
            miles), we found no coals: the Pasha had been up and taken them all. So we kicked our
            heels on the bank all day, with the prospect of doing so for a week. The captain brought
            H.R.H. of Darfoor to visit me, and to beg me to make him hear reason about the delay, as
            I, being English, must know that a steamer could not go without coals. H.R.H. was a
            pretty imperious little nigger about eleven or twelve, dressed in a yellow silk kuftan
            and a scarlet burnous, who cut the good old captain short by saying, ‘Why, she is a
            woman; she can’t talk to me.’ ‘Wallah! wallah! what a way to talk to English Hareem!’
            shrieked the captain, who was about to lose his temper; but I had a happy idea and
            produced a box of French sweetmeats, which altered the young Prince’s views at once. I
            asked if he had brothers. ‘Who can count them? they are like mice.’ He said that the
            Pasha had given him only a few presents, and was evidently not pleased. Some of his
            suite are the most formidable-looking wild beasts in human shape I ever beheld—bulldogs
            and wild-boars black as ink, red-eyed, and, ye gods! such jowls and throats and
            teeth!—others like monkeys, with arms down to their knees. </p>
         <p> The Illyrian Arnouts on board our boat are revoltingly white—like fish or drowned
            people, no pink in the tallowy skin at all. There were Greeks also who left us at Minieh
            (second large town), and the old Pasha left this morning at Rodah. The captain at once
            ordered all my goods into the cabin he had left and turned out the Turkish Effendi, who
            wanted to stay and sleep with us. No impropriety! he said he was an old man and sick,
            and my company would be agreeable to him; then he said he was ashamed before the people
            to be turned out by an English woman. So I was civil and begged him to pass the day and
            to dine with me, and that set all right, and now after dinner he has gone off quite
            pleasantly to the fore-cabin and left me here. I have a stern-cabin, a saloon and an
            anteroom here, so we are comfortable enough—only the fleas! Never till now did I know
            what fleas could be; even Omar groaned and tossed in his sleep, and Sally and I woke
            every ten minutes. Perhaps this cabin may be better, some fleas may have landed in the
            beds of the Turks. I send a dish from my table every day henceforth to the captain; as I
            take the place of a Pasha it is part of my dignity to do so; and as I occupy the kitchen
            and burn the ship’s coals, I may as well let the captain dine a little at my expense. In
            the day I go up and sit in his cabin on deck, and we talk as well as we can without an
            interpreter. The old fellow is sixty-seven, but does not look more than forty-five. He
            has just the air and manner of a seafaring-man with us, and has been wrecked four
            times—the last in the Black Sea during the Crimean War, when he was taken prisoner by
            the Russians and sent to Moscow for three years, until the peace. He has a charming boy
            of eleven with him, and he tells me he has twelve children in all, but only one wife,
            and is as strict a monogamist as Dr. Primrose, for he told me he should not marry again
            if she died, nor he believed would she. He is surprised at my gray hair. </p>
         <p> There are a good many Copts on board too, of a rather low class and not pleasant. The
            Christian gentlemen are very pleasant, but the low are _low_ indeed compared to the
            Muslimeen, and one gets a feeling of dirtiness about them to see them eat all among the
            coals, and then squat there and pull out their beads to pray without washing their hands
            even. It does look nasty when compared to the Muslim coming up clean washed, and
            standing erect and manly—looking to his prayers; besides they are coarse in their
            manners and conversation and have not the Arab respect for women. I only speak of the
            common people—not of educated Copts. The best fun was to hear the Greeks (one of whom
            spoke English) abusing the Copts—rogues, heretics, schismatics from the Greek Church,
            ignorant, rapacious, cunning, impudent, etc., etc. In short, they narrated the whole
            fable about their own sweet selves. I am quite surprised to see how well these men
            manage their work. The boat is quite as clean as an English boat as crowded could be
            kept, and the engine in beautiful order. The head-engineer, Achmet Effendi, and indeed
            all the crew and captain too, wear English clothes and use the universal ‘All right,
            stop her—fooreh (full) speed, half speed—turn her head,’ etc. I was delighted to hear
            ‘All right—go ahead—_el-Fathah_’ in one breath. Here we always say the _Fathah_ (first
            chapter of the Koran, nearly identical with the Lord’s Prayer) when starting on a
            journey, concluding a bargain, etc. The combination was very quaint. There are rats and
            fleas on board, but neither bugs nor cockroaches. Already the climate has changed, the
            air is sensibly drier and clearer and the weather much warmer, and we are not yet at
            Siout. I remarked last year that the climate changed most at Keneh, forty miles below
            Thebes. The banks are terribly broken and washed away by the inundation, and the Nile
            far higher even now than it was six weeks earlier last year. </p>
         <p> At Benisouef, which used to be the great cattle place, not a buffalo was left, and we
            could not get a drop of milk. But since we left Minieh we see them again, and I hear the
            disease is not spreading up the river. Omar told me that the poor people at Benisouef
            were complaining of the drought and prospect of scarcity, as they could no longer water
            the land for want of oxen. I paid ten napoleons passage-money, and shall give four or
            five more as backsheesh, as I have given a good deal of trouble with all my luggage,
            beddings, furniture, provisions for four months, etc., and the boat’s people have been
            more than civil, really kind and attentive to us; but a bad dahabieh would have cost
            forty, so I am greatly the gainer. Nothing can exceed the muddle, uncertainty and
            carelessness of the ‘administration’ at <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName>: no
            coals at the depots, boats announced to sail and dawdling on three weeks, no order and
            no care for anybody’s convenience but the Pasha’s own. But the subordinates on board the
            boats do their work perfectly well. We go only half as quickly as we ought because we
            have two very heavy dahabiehs in tow instead of one; but no time is lost, as long as the
            light lasts we go, and start again as soon as the moon rises. The people on board have
            promoted me in rank—and call me ‘el-Ameereh,’ an obsolete Arab title which the engineer
            thinks is the equivalent of ‘Ladysheep,’ as he calls it. ‘Sitti,’ he said, was the same
            as ‘Meessees.’ I don’t know how he acquired his ideas on the subject of English
            precedence. </p>
         <p> Omar has just come in with coffee, and begs me to give his best salaam to his big
            master and his little master and lady, and not to forget to tell them he is their
            servant and my memlook (slave) ‘from one hand to the other’ (the whole body). If we stay
            at all at Siout, I will ride a donkey up to Wassef’s house, and leave this letter for
            him to send down with his next opportunity to <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName>.
            At Keneh we must try to find time to buy two filters and some gullehs (water-coolers);
            they are made there. At Thebes nothing can be got. </p>
         <p> How I do wish you were here to enjoy all the new and strange sights! I am sure it would
            amuse you, and as the fleas don’t bite you there would be no drawback. Janet sent me a
            photo of dear little Rainie; it is ugly, but very like the ‘zuweyeh’ (little one). Give
            her no end of kisses, and thank her for the cock robin, which pleased me quite as much
            as she thought it would.</p>
