            <l>‘If in the street I led thee, dearest,</l>
            <l>Though the veil hid thy face divine,</l>
            <l>They who beheld thy graceful motion</l>
            <l>Would stagger as though drunk with wine.</l>

         <lg>
            <l>Nay, e’en the holy Sheykh, while praying</l>
            <l>For guidance in the narrow way,</l>
            <l>Must needs leave off, and on the traces</l>
            <l>Of thine enchanting footsteps stray.</l>
         </lg>

         <lg>
            <l>O ye who go down in the boats to Dumyat,</l>
            <l>Cross, I beseech ye, the stream to Budallah;</l>
            <l>Seek my beloved, and beg that she will not</l>
            <l>Forget me, I pray and implore her by Allah.</l>
         </lg>

         <lg>
            <l>‘Fair as two moons is the face of my sweetheart,</l>
            <l>And as to her neck and her bosom—Mashallah.</l>
            <l>And unless to my love I am soon reunited</l>
            <l>Death is my portion—I swear it by Allah.’</l>

         <p>Thus sings <name type="person" ref="#ali_asleemee">Ali Asleemee</name>, the most <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="fr">debraillé</foreign></hi> of my crew, a <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">hashshásh</foreign></hi><note>A smoker or
               eater of <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">hasheeshs</foreign></hi>
               (hemp).</note>, but a singer and a good fellow. The translation is not free, though
            the sentiments are. I merely rhymed <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name>’s
            literal word-for-word interpretation. The songs are all in a similar strain, except one
            funny one abusing the ‘Sheykh el-Beled, may the fleas bite him.’ Horrid imprecation! as
            I know to my cost, for after visiting the Coptic monks at <name type="place" ref="#girgeh">Girgeh</name> I came home to the boat with myriads. <name type="person" ref="#sally">Sally</name> said she felt like <name type="person" ref="#ramses">Rameses the
               Great</name>, so tremendous was the slaughter of the active enemy.</p>

         <p>I had written the first page just as I got to <name type="place" ref="#siout">Siout</name> and was stopped by bad news of <name type="person" ref="#janet">Janet</name>; but now all is right again, and I am to meet her in <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name>, and she proposes a jaunt to <name type="place" ref="#suez">Suez</name> and to <name type="place" ref="#damietta">Damietta</name>. I have got a
            superb illumination to-night, improvised by <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name>
            in honour of the Prince of Wales’s marriage, and consequently am writing with flaring
            candles, my lantern being on duty at the masthead, and the men are singing an
            epithalamium and beating the tarabookeh as loud as they can.</p>

         <p>You will have seen my letter to my mother, and heard how much better I am for the
            glorious air of <name type="place" ref="#nubia">Nubia</name> and the high up-country.
            Already we are returning into misty weather. I dined and spent the day with <name type="person" ref="#wassef">Wassef</name> and his <foreign xml:lang="ar">Hareem</foreign>, such an amiable, kindly household. I was charmed with their manner
            to each other, to the slaves and family. The slaves (all Muslims) told <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> what an excellent master they had. He had meant
            to make a dance-fantasia, but as I had not good news it was countermanded. Poor <name type="person" ref="#wassef">Wassef</name> ate his boiled beans rather ruefully, while
            his wife and I had an excellent dinner, she being excused fasting on account of a coming
            baby. The Copt fast is no joke, neither butter, milk, eggs nor fish being allowed for
            fifty-five days. They made <name type="person" ref="#sally">Sally</name> dine with us, and <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> was admitted to wait and interpret. <name type="person" ref="#wassef">Wassef</name>’s younger brother waited on him as in the
            Bible, and his clerk, a nice young fellow, assisted. Black slaves brought the dishes in,
            and capital the food was. There was plenty of joking between the lady and <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> about Ramadan, which he had broken, and the
            Nasranee fast, and also about the number of wives allowed, the young clerk intimating
            that he rather liked that point in Islam. I have promised to spend ten or twelve days at
            their house if ever I go up the Nile again. I have also promised to send <name type="person" ref="#wassef">Wassef</name> all particulars as to the expense, etc. of
            educating his boy in England, and to look after him and have him to our house in the
            holidays. I can’t describe how anxiously kind these people were to me. One gets such a
            wonderful amount of sympathy and real hearty kindness here. A curious instance of the
            affinity of the British mind for prejudice is the way in which every Englishman I have
            seen scorns the Eastern Christians, and droll enough that sinners like Kinglake and I
            should be the only people to feel the tie of the ‘common faith’ (<hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="lat">vide</foreign></hi> ‘Eothen’). A very pious Scotch
            gentleman wondered that I could think of entering a Copt’s house, adding that they were
            the publicans (tax-gatherers) of this country, which is partly true. I felt inclined to
            mention that better company than he or I had dined with publicans, and even sinners.</p>

         <p>The Copts are evidently the ancient Egyptians. The slightly aquiline nose and long eye
            are the very same as the profiles of the tombs and temples, and also like the very
            earliest Byzantine pictures; <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="fr">du
                  reste</foreign></hi>, the face is handsome, but generally sallow and rather
            inclined to puffiness, and the figure wants the grace of the Arabs. Nor has any Copt the
            thoroughbred, <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="fr">distingué</foreign></hi>
            look of the meanest man or woman of good Arab blood. Their feet are the long-toed,
            flattish foot of the Egyptian statue, while the Arab foot is classically perfect and you
            could put your hand under the instep. The beauty of the Ababdeh, black, naked, and
            shaggy-haired, is quite marvellous. I never saw such delicate limbs and features, or
            such eyes and teeth.</p>

               19</date>.</p>

         <p>After leaving <name type="place" ref="#siout">Siout</name> I caught cold. The worst of
            going up the Nile is that one must come down again and find horrid fogs, and cold nights
            with sultry days. So I did not attempt <name type="place" ref="#sakhara">Sakhara</name>
            and the Pyramids, but came a day before my appointed time to <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name>. Up here in the town it is much warmer and dryer, and my
            cough is better already. I found all your letters in many volumes, and was so excited
            over reading them that I could not sleep one moment last night, so excuse dulness, but I
            thought you’d like to know I was safe in Briggs’ bank, and expecting <name type="person" ref="#janet">Janet</name> and <name type="person" ref="#ross">Ross</name>
            to-night.</p>
