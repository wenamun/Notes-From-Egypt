         <p>Dearest <foreign xml:lang="de"><name type="person" ref="#sarah_austin">Mutter</name></foreign>,</p>

         <p>I write to you out of the real Arabian Nights. Well may the Prophet (whose name be
            exalted) smile when he looks on <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name>. It is a
            golden existence, all sunshine and poetry, and, <hi rendition="italic">I</hi> must add,
            kindness and civility. I came up last <date when="1862-11-06">Thursday</date> by railway
            with the American Consul-General, a charming person, and had to stay at this horrid
            Shepheard's Hotel. But I do little but sleep here. <name type="person" ref="#hekekian_bey">Hekekian Bey</name>, a learned old Armenian, takes care of me
            every day, and the Amerian Vice-Consul is my sacrifice. I went on <date when="1862-11-09">Sunday</date> to his child's christening, and heard Sakna, the
               <q>Restorer of Hearts.</q> She is wonderfully like <name type="person" ref="#rachel">Rachel</name>, and her singing is <foreign xml:lang="de">hinreisend</foreign> from
            expression and passion. <name type="person" ref="#wilkinson">Mr. Wilkinson</name> (the
            Consul) is a Levantine, and his wife Armenian, so they had a grand fantasia; people
            feasted all over the house and in the street. Arab music <foreign xml:lang="de">schmetterte</foreign>, women yelled the <foreign xml:lang="ar">zaghareet</foreign>,
            black servants served sweetmeats, pipes, and coffee, and behaved as if they belonged to
            the company, and I was strongly under the impression that I was at Nurreddin's wedding
            with the Vizier's daughter. Yesterday I went to <name type="place" ref="#heliopolis">Heliopolis</name> with <name type="person" ref="#hekekian_bey">Hekekian Bey</name>
            and his wife, and visited an Armenian country lady close by.</p>

         <p>My servant <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> turns out a jewel. He has
               <foreign xml:lang="fr">deterre</foreign> an excellent boat for the Nile voyage, and I
            am to be mistress of a captain, a mate, eight men and a cabin boy for 25 pounds a month.
            I went to <name type="place" ref="#boulak">Boulak</name>, the port of <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name>, and saw various boats, and admired the way in which the
            English travellers pay for their insolence and caprices. Similar boats cost people with
            dragomans 50 to 65 pounds. But, then, 'I shall lick the fellows,' etc., is what I hear
            all round. The dragoman, I conclude, pockets the difference. The owner of the boat,
               <name type="person" ref="#sid_achmet_el_berberi">Sid Achmet el-Berberi</name>, asked
            30 pounds, whereupon I touched my breast, mouth and eyes, and stated through <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> that I was not, like other Ingeleez, made of
            money, but would give 20 pounds. He then showed another boat at 20 pounds, very much
            worse, and I departed (with fresh civilities) and looked at others, and saw two more for
            20 pounds; but neither was clean, and neither had a little boat for landing. Meanwhile
               <name type="person" ref="#sid_achmet_el_berberi">Sid Achmet</name> came after me and
            explained that, if I was not like other Ingeleez in money, I likewise differed in
            politeness, and had refrained from abuse, etc., etc., and I should have the boat for 25
            pounds. It was so very excellent in all fittings, and so much larger, that I thought it
            would make a great difference in health, so I said if he would go before the American
            Vice-Consul (who is looked on as a sharp hand) and would promise all he said to me
            before him, it should be well.</p>

         <p>
            <name type="person" ref="#thayer">Mr. Thayer</name>, the American Consul-General, gives
            me letters to every consular agent depending on him; and two Coptic merchants whom I met
            at the fantasia have already begged me to <q>honour their houses.</q> I rather think the
            poor agents, who are all Armenians and Copts, will think I am the republic in person.
            The weather has been all this time like a splendid English August, and I hope I shall
            get rid of my cough in time, but it has been very bad. There is no cold at night here as
            at the Cape, but it is nothing like so clear and bright.</p>

         <p>
            <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> took <name type="person" ref="#sally">Sally</name> sightseeing all day while I was away, into several mosques; in one he
            begged her to wait a minute while he said a prayer. They compare notes about their
            respective countries and are great friends; but he is put out at my not having provided
            her with a husband long ago, as is one's duty towards a <q>female servant,</q> which
            almost always here means a slave.</p>

         <p>Of all the falsehoods I have heard about the East, that about women being old hags at
            thirty is the biggest. Among the poor fellah women it may be true enough, but not nearly
            as much as in Germany; and I have now seen a considerable number of Levantine ladies
            looking very handsome, or at least comely, till fifty. <name type="person" ref="#sakna">Sakna</name>, the Arab Grisi, is fifty-five--an ugly face, I am told (she was veiled
            and one only saw the eyes and glimpses of her mouth when she drank water), but the
            figure of a leopard, all grace and beauty, and a splendid voice of its kind, harsh but
            thrilling like <name type="person" ref="#malibran">Malibran</name>'s. I guessed her
            about thirty, or perhaps thirty-five. When she improvised, the finesse and grace of her
            whole <foreign xml:lang="de">Wesen</foreign> were ravishing. I was on the point of
            shouting out <q>Wallah!</q> as heartily as the natives. The eight younger <foreign xml:lang="ar">Halmeh</foreign> (i.e., learned women, which the English call Almeh and
            think is an improper word) were ugly and screeched. <name type="person" ref="#sakna">Sakna</name> was treated with great consideration and quite as a friend by the
            Armenian ladies with whom she talked between her songs. She is a Muslimeh and very rich
            and charitable; she gets 50 pounds for a night's singing at least.</p>

         <p>It would be very easy to learn colloquial Arabic, as they all speak with such perfect
            distinctness that one can follow the sentences and catch the words one knows as they are
            repeated. I think I know forty or fifty words already, besides my <q>
               <foreign xml:lang="ar">salaam aleikum</foreign>
            </q> and <q>
               <foreign xml:lang="ar">backsheesh.</foreign>
            </q>
         </p>
         <p>The reverse of the brilliant side of the medal is sad enough: deserted palaces, and
            crowded hovels scarce good enough for pigstyes. <q>One day man see his dinner, and one
               other day none at all,</q> as <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> observes;
            and the children are shocking from bad food, dirt and overwork, but the little
            pot-bellied, blear-eyed wretches grow up into noble young men and women under all their
            difficulties. The faces are all sad and rather what the Scotch call 'dour,' not <foreign xml:lang="fr">mechant</foreign> at all, but harsh, like their voices. All the melody
            is in walk and gesture; they are as graceful as cats, and the women have exactly the
               <q>breasts like pomegranates</q> of their poetry. A tall Bedaween woman came up to us
            in the field yesterday to shake hands and look at us. She wore a white sackcloth shift
            and veil, <foreign xml:lang="de">und weiter nichts</foreign>, and asked <name type="person" ref="#hekekian">Mrs. Hekekian</name> a good many questions about me,
            looked at my face and hands, but took no notice of my rather smart gown which the
            village women admired so much, shook hands again with the air of a princess, wished me
            health and happiness, and strode off across the graveyard like a stately ghost. She was
            on a journey all alone, and somehow it looked very solemn and affecting to see her
            walking away towards the desert in the setting sun like Hagar. All is so Scriptural in
            the country here. <name type="person" ref="#sally">Sally</name> called out in the
            railroad, <q>There is <name type="person" ref="#boaz">Boaz</name>, sitting in the
               cornfield</q>; and so it was, and there he has sat for how many thousand years,--and
               <name type="person" ref="#sakna">Sakna</name> sang just like <name type="person" ref="#miriam">Miriam</name> in one war-song.</p>

         <p>
            <date when="1862-11">Wednesday.</date>--My contract was drawn up and signed by the
            American Vice-Consul to-day, and my Reis kissed my hand in due form, after which I went
            to the <foreign xml:lang="ar">bazaar</foreign> to buy the needful pots and pans. The
            transaction lasted an hour. The copper is so much per oka, the workmanship so much;
            every article is weighed by a sworn weigher and a ticket sent with it. More Arabian
            Nights. The shopkeeper compares notes with me about numerals, and is as much amused as
            I. He treats me to coffee and a pipe from a neighbouring shop while <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> eloquently depreciates the goods and offers half the value. A
            water-seller offers a brass cup of water; I drink, and give the huge sum of twopence,
            and he distributes the contents of his skin to the crowd (there always is a crowd) in my
            honour. It seems I have done a pious action. Finally a boy is called to carry the
               <foreign xml:lang="fr">batterie de cuisine</foreign>, while <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> brandishes a gigantic kettle which he has picked up a little
            bruised for four shillings. The boy has a donkey which I mount astride <foreign xml:lang="fr">a l'Arabe</foreign>, while the boy carries all the copper things on his
            head. We are rather a grand procession, and quite enjoy the fury of the dragomans and
            other leeches who hang on the English at such independent proceedings, and <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> gets reviled for spoiling the trade by being
            cook, dragoman, and all in one.</p>

         <p>I went this morning with <name type="person" ref="#hekekian_bey">Hekekian Bey</name> to
            the two earliest mosques. The Touloun is exquisite--noble, simple, and what ornament
            there is is the most delicate lacework and embossing in stone and wood. This Arab
            architecture is even more lovely than our Gothic. The Touloun is now a vast poorhouse, a
            nest of paupers. I went into three of their lodgings. Several Turkish families were in a
            large square room neatly divided into little partitions with old mats hung on ropes. In
            each were as many bits of carpet, mat and patchwork as the poor owner could collect, and
            a small chest and a little brick cooking-place in one corner of the room with three
            earthern pipkins for I don't know how many people;--that was all--they possess no sort
            of furniture, but all was scrupulously clean and no bad smell whatever. A little boy
            seized my hand and showed where he slept, ate and cooked with the most expressive
            pantomime. As there were women, <name type="person" ref="#hekekian_bey">Hekekian</name>
            could not come in, but when I came out an old man told us they received three loaves
            (cakes as big as a sailor's biscuit), four piastres a month--<hi rendition="italic">i.e.</hi>, eightpence per adult--a suit of clothes a year, and on festive occasions
            lentil soup. Such is the almshouse here. A little crowd belonging to the house had
            collected, and I gave sixpence to an old man, who transferred it to the first old man to
            be <hi rendition="italic">divided</hi> among them all, ten or twelve people at least,
            mostly blind or lame. The poverty wrings my heart. We took leave with <foreign xml:lang="ar">salaam</foreign>s and politeness like the best society, and then turned
            into an Arab hut stuck against the lovely arches. I stooped low under the door, and
            several women crowded in. This was still poorer, for there were no mats or rags of
            carpet, a still worse cooking-place, a sort of dog-kennel piled up of loose stones to
            sleep in, which contained a small chest and the print of human forms on the stone floor.
            It was, however, quite free from dust, and perfectly sweet. I gave the young woman who
            had led me in sixpence, and here the difference between Turk and Arab appeared. The
            division of this created a perfect storm of noise, and we left the five or six Arab
            women out-shrieking a whole rookery. I ought to say that no one begged at all.</p>

         <p>
            <date when="1862-11">Friday</date>.--I went to-day on a donkey to a mosque in the
               <foreign xml:lang="ar">bazaar</foreign>, of what we call Arabesque style, like the
               <name type="place" ref="#alhambra">Alhambra</name>, very handsome. The <foreign xml:lang="ar">Kibleh</foreign> was very beautiful, and as I was admiring it <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> pulled a lemon out of his breast and smeared it
            on the porphyry pillar on one side of the arch, and then entreated me to lick it. It
            cures all diseases. The old man who showed the mosque pulled eagerly at my arm to make
            me perform this absurd ceremony, and I thought I should have been forced to do it. The
            base of the pillar was clogged with lemon-juice. I then went to the tombs of the
               <foreign xml:lang="ar">Khalifah</foreign>; one of the great ones had such arches and
            such wondrous cupolas but all in ruins. There are scores of these noble buildings, any
            one of which is a treasure, falling to decay. The next, strange to say, was in perfect
            repair. I got off the donkey, and <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> fidgeted
            and hesitated a little and consulted with a woman who had the key. As there were no
            overshoes I pulled my boots off, and was rewarded by seeing the footprints of <name type="person" ref="#mohammed">Mohammed</name> on two black stones, and a lovely
            little mosque, a sort of <foreign xml:lang="fr">Sainte Chapelle</foreign>. <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> prayed with ardent fervour and went out
            backwards, saluting the Prophet aloud. To my surprise the woman was highly pleased with
            sixpence, and did not ask for more. When I remarked this, <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> said that no Frank had ever been inside to his knowledge. A
            mosque-keeper of the sterner sex would not have let me in. I returned home through
            endless streets and squares of Moslem tombs, those of the Memlooks among them. It was
            very striking; and it was getting so dark that I thought of <name type="person" ref="#nurreddin_bey">Nurreddin Bey</name>, and wondered if a <foreign xml:lang="ar">Jinn</foreign> would take me anywhere if I took up my night's lodging in one of the
            comfortable little cupola-covered buildings.</p>

         <p>My Coptic friend has just called in to say that his brother expects me at <name type="place" ref="#kenneh">Kenneh</name>. I find nothing but civility and a desire to
            please. My boat is the <rs>
               <foreign xml:lang="ar">Zint el Bachreyn</foreign>
            </rs>, and I carry the English flag and a small American distinguishing pennant as a
            signal to my consular agents. We sail next <date when="1862-11">Wednesday</date>.
            Good-bye for the present, dearest <foreign xml:lang="de"><name type="person" ref="#sarah_austin">Mutter</name></foreign>.</p>
