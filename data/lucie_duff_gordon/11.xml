         <p>Dearest <foreign xml:lang="de"><name type="person" ref="#sarah_austin">Mutter</name></foreign>,</p>

         <p>I have been here a fortnight, but the climate disagrees so much with me that I am going
            back to <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name> at once by the advice of the doctor
            of the <name type="place" ref="#suez">Suez</name> Canal. I cannot shake off my cough
            here. Mr. <name type="person" ref="#thayer">Thayer</name> kindly lends me his nice little bachelor
            house, and I take <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> back again for the job. It
            is very hot here, but with a sea-breeze which strikes me like ice; strong people enjoy
            it, but it gives even <name type="person" ref="#janet">Janet</name> cold in the head.
            She is very well, I think, and seems very happy. She is <hi rendition="italic">Times</hi> correspondent and does it very well.</p>

         <p>I am terribly disappointed at not being as materially better as I had hoped I should be
            while in Upper Egypt. I cannot express the longing I have for home and my children, and
            how much I feel the sort of suspense it all causes to you and to <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>, and my desire to be with you.</p>

         <p>One must come to the East to understand absolute equality. As there is no education and
            no reason why the donkey-boy who runs behind me may not become a great man, and as all
            Muslims are <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="lat">ipso facto</foreign></hi>
            equal; money and rank are looked on as mere accidents, and my <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="fr">avoir vivre</foreign></hi> was highly thought of because I
            sat down with Fellaheen and treated everyone as they treat each other. In <name type="place" ref="#alexandria">Alexandria</name> all that is changed. The European
            ideas and customs have extinguished the Arab altogether, and those who remain are not
            improved by the contact. Only the <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="ar">Bedaween</foreign></hi> preserve their haughty <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="lat">nonchalance</foreign></hi>. I found the Mograbee <foreign xml:lang="ar">bazaar</foreign> full of them when I went to buy a white cloak, and was
            amused at the way in which one splendid bronze figure, who lay on the shop-front, moved
            one leg to let me sit down. They got interested in my purchase, and assisted in making
            the bargain and wrapping the cloak round me Bedawee fashion, and they too complimented
            me on having ‘the face of the Arab,’ which means Bedaween. I wanted a little Arab dress
            for <name type="person" ref="#rainie">Rainie</name>, but could not find one, as at her
            age none are worn in the desert.</p>

         <p>I dined one day with <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name>, or rather I ate at his
            house, for he would not eat with me. His sister-in-law cooked a most admirable dinner,
            and everyone was delighted. It was an interesting family circle. A very respectable
            elder brother a confectioner, whose elder wife was a black woman, a really remarkable
            person, who speaks Italian perfectly, and gave me a great deal of information and asked
            such intelligent questions. She ruled the house but had no children, so he had married a
            fair, gentle-looking Arab woman who had six children, and all lived in perfect harmony.
               <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name>’s wife is a tall, handsome girl of his
            own age, with very good manners. She had been outside the door of the close little court
            which constituted the house <hi rendition="italic">once</hi> since her marriage. I now
            begin to understand all about the <hi rendition="italic"><foreign xml:lang="de">wesen</foreign></hi> with the women. There is a good deal of chivalry in some
            respects, and in the respectable lower and middle classes the result is not so bad. I
            suspect that among the rich few are very happy. But I don’t know them, or anything of
            the Turkish ways. I will go and see the black woman again and hear more, her
            conversation was really interesting.</p>
