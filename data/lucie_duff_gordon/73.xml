         <p>Dearest <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>, </p>
         <p> I write to be ready for the last _down_ steamer which will be here in a few days. Mr.
            and Miss North are here working hard at sketching, and M. Brune will take a place in
            their Dahabieh (my old Zint el Bahreyn), and leave me in six or seven days. I shall
            quite grieve to lose his company. If ever you or yours fall in with him, pray cultivate
            his acquaintance, he is very clever, very hard working, and a ‘thorough-bred gentleman’
            as <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> declares. We are quite low-spirited at
            parting after a month spent together at <name type="place" ref="#thebes">Thebes</name>. </p>
         <p> I hear that Olagnier has a big house in Old <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name> and will lodge me. The Norths go to-day (Thursday) and M. Brune does
            not go with them as he intended, but will stay on and finish a good stroke of work and
            take his chance of a conveyance. </p>
         <p> I spent yesterday out in Mustapha’s tent among the bean gatherers, and will go again. I
            think it does me good and is not too long a ride. The weather has set in suddenly very
            hot, which rather tries everybody, but gloriously fine clear air. I hope you will get
            this, as old fat Hassan will take it to the office in <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name> himself—for the post is very insecure indeed. I have written very
            often, if you don’t get my letters I suppose they interest the court of Pharaoh. </p>
