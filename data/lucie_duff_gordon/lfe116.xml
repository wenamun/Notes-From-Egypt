         <p>DEAREST ALICK, </p>
         <p> We are just arriving at Minieh whence the railway will take letters quickly. We dined
            at Keneh and at Siout with some friends, and had fantasia at Keneh. Omar desires his
            dutiful salaams to you and hopes you will be satisfied with the care he has taken of
            ‘the child.’ How you would have been amused to hear the girl who came to dance for us at
            Esneh lecture Maurice about evil ways, but she was an old friend of mine, and gave good
            and sound advice. </p>
         <p> Everyone is delighted about Abyssinia. ‘Thank God our Pasha will fear the English more
            than before, and the Sultan also,’ and when I lamented the expense, they all exclaimed,
            ‘Never mind the expense, it is worth more than ten millions to you; your faces are
            whitened and your power enlarged before all the world; but why don’t you take us on your
            way back.’ </p>
         <p> I saw a very interesting man at Keneh, one Faam, a Copt, who has turned Presbyterian,
            and has induced a hundred others at Koos to do likewise: an American missionary is their
            minister. Faam was sent off to the Soudan by the Patriarch, but brought back. He is a
            splendid old fellow, and I felt I looked on the face of a Christian martyr, a curious
            sight in the nineteenth century: the calm, fearless, rapt expression was like what you
            see in noble old Italian pictures, and he had the perfect absence of ‘doing pious’ which
            shows the undoubting faith. He and the Mufti, also a noble fellow, sparred about
            religion in a jocose and friendly tone which would be quite unintelligible in Exeter
            Hall. When he was gone the Mufti said, ‘Ah! we thank them, for though they know not the
            truth of Islam, they are good men, and walk straight, and would die for their religion:
            their example is excellent; praise be to God for them.’</p>
