         <p>Dearest <foreign xml:lang="de"><name type="person" ref="#sarah_austin">Mutter</name></foreign>, </p>
         <p> I arrived here last night and found a whole heap of letters—and yours I will answer
            first. I had no heart to write any more from <name type="place" ref="#alexandria">Alexandria </name> where I was worried out of all courage and strength. At last
            after endless delays and vexations the dahabieh was _tant bien que mal_ ready. </p>
         <p> Talk of Arab dawdle! after what I went through—and now I have to wait here for fresh
            repairs, as we came up baling all the way and I fear cursing the Christian workmen who
            had bungled so shamefully. </p>
         <p> However that is over, and I am much better as to my cough—indeed it is all but gone.
               <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> was very ill having had dysentery for two
            months, but he too is well again. He is very grateful for your kind mention of him and
            says, ‘Send the Great Mother my best Salaam, and tell her her daughter’s people are my
            people, and where she goes I will go too, and please God I will serve her rich or poor
            till “He who separates us” shall take me from her.’ The words of Ruth came after all
            these centuries quite fresh from the soft Egyptian lips. </p>
         <p> The ‘He who separated us’ I must explain to you. It is one of the attributes of God,
            _The Separator of Religions_ implies toleration and friendship by attributing the two
            religions alike to God—and is never used towards one whose religion is not to be
            respected. </p>
         <p> I have got a levee of former reis’s, sailors, etc. some sick—but most come to talk. </p>
         <p> The climate changes quite suddenly as one leaves the Delta, and here I sit at eight in
            the evening with open doors and windows. </p>
         <p> I am so glad to hear of the great success of my dear Father’s book, and to think of
            your courage in working at it still. </p>
         <p> I suppose I shall be here a week longer as I have several jobs to do to my boat, and I
            shall try to get towed up so as to send back the boat as soon as possible in order to
            let her. Ali will give £80 a month for her if he gets a party of four to take up. I pay
            my <name type="person" ref="#reis">Reis</name> five napoleons a month while travelling
            and three while lying still. He is a good, active little fellow. </p>
         <p> We were nearly smashed under the railway bridge by an iron barge—and _Wallah_! how the
               <name type="person" ref="#reis">Reis</name> of the bridge did whack the <name type="person" ref="#reis">Reis</name> of the barge. I thought it a sad loss of time,
            but <name type="person" ref="#reis">Reis</name> Ali and my <name type="person" ref="#reis">Reis</name> Mohammed seemed to look on the stick as the most effective
            way of extricating my anchor from the Pasha’s rudder. My crew can’t say ‘Urania’ so they
            sing ‘go along, oh darling bride’ _Arooset er-ralee_, as the little Sitt’s best
            description, and ‘Arooset er-ralee’ will be the dahabieh’s exoteric name—as ‘_El
            Beshoosheeh_, is my popular name.</p>
