         <p>DEAREST ALICK, </p>
         <p> I am enjoying a ‘great indulgence of talk’ with M. Prévost Paradol as heartily as any
            nigger. He is a delightful person. This evening he is coming with Arakel Bey, his
            Armenian companion, and I will invite a few Arabs to show him. I sent off the proofs
            yesterday per passenger steamer. I trust they will arrive safe. It is too disheartening
            about letters, so many are lost. I am dreadfully disappointed in my letters, I _really_
            don’t think them good—you know I don’t _blaguer_ about my own performances. I am very
            glad people like my Cape letters which I forget—but honestly I don’t think the Egyptian
            good. You know I don’t ‘pretend’ if I think I have done something well and I was
            generally content with my translations, but I feel these all to be poor and what Maurice
            calls ‘dry’ when I know how curious and interesting and poetical the country really is. </p>
         <p> I paid Fadil Pasha a visit on his boat, and it was just like the middle ages. In order
            to amuse me he called up a horrid little black boy of about four to do tricks like a
            dancing dog, which ended in a performance of the Mussulman prayer. The little beast was
            dressed in a Stamboulee dress of scarlet cloth. </p>
         <p> All the Arab doctors come to see me now as they go up and down the river to give me
            help if I want it. Some are very pleasant men. Mourad Effendi speaks German exactly like
            a German. The old Sheykh-el-Beled of Erment who visits me whenever he comes here, and
            has the sweetest voice I ever heard, complained of the climate of <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName>. ‘There is no sun there at all, it is no brighter or warmer than
            the moon.’ What do you think our sun must be now you know <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName>. We have had a glorious winter, like the finest summer weather at
            home only so much finer. </p>
         <p> Janet wishes to go with me if I go to Soden, I must make enquiries about the climate.
            Ross fears it is too cold for an Egyptian like me. I should enjoy to have all the family
            _au grand complet_. I will leave Luxor in May and get to you towards the latter part of
            June, if that pleases you, _Inshallah_! </p>
