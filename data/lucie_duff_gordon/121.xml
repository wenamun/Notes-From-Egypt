         <p>Dearest <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>, </p>
         <p> Do not think of coming here. Indeed it would be almost too painful to me to part from
            you again; and as it is, I can patiently wait for the end among people who are kind and
            loving enough to be comfortable, without too much feeling of the pain of parting. The
            leaving Luxor was rather a distressing scene, as they did not think to see me again. </p>
         <p> The kindness of all the people was really touching, from the Kadee who made ready my
            tomb among his own family, to the poorest fellaheen. <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name> sends you his most heartfelt thanks, and begs that the boat may remain
            registered at the Consulate in your name for his use and benefit. The Prince has
            appointed him his own dragoman. But he is sad enough, poor fellow, all his prosperity
            does not console him for the loss of ‘the mother he found in the world.’ Mohammed at
            Luxor wept bitterly and said, ‘poor I, my poor children, poor all the people,’ and
            kissed my hand passionately, and the people at <name type="place" ref="#esneh">Esneh</name>, asked leave to touch me ‘for a blessing,’ and everyone sent delicate
            bread, and their best butter, and vegetables and lambs. They are kinder than ever now
            that I can no longer be of any use to them. </p>
         <p> If I live till September I will go up to <name type="place" ref="#esneh">Esneh</name>,
            where the air is softest and I cough less. I would rather die among my own people in the
            Saeed than here. </p>
         <p> You must forgive this scrawl, dearest. Don’t think please of sending <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name> out again, he must begin to work now or
            he will never be good for anything. </p>
         <p> Can you thank the Prince of Wales for <name type="person" ref="#omar">Omar</name>, or
            shall I write? He was most pleasant and kind, and the Princess too. She is the most
            perfectly simple-mannered girl I ever saw. She does not even try to be civil like other
            great people, but asks blunt questions, and looks at one so heartily with her clear,
            honest eyes, that she must win all hearts. They were more considerate than any people I
            have seen, and the Prince, instead of being gracious, was, if I may say so, quite
            respectful in his manner: he is very well bred and pleasant, and has the honest eyes
            that makes one sure he has a kind heart. </p>
         <p> My sailors were so proud at having the honour of rowing him _in our own boat_, and of
            singing to him. I had a very good singer in the boat. Please send some little present
            for my <name type="person" ref="#reis">Reis</name>: he is such a good man; he will be
            pleased at some little thing from you. He is half Turk, and seems like whole one. <name type="person" ref="#maurice">Maurice</name> will have told you all about us. Good-bye
            for the present, dearest <name type="person" ref="#alick">Alick</name>.</p>
