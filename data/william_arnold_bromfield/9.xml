         <p>My dear <name type="person" ref="#eliza_bromfield">E</name>
            </p>

         <p>I gladly avail myself of the opportunity afforded me by the place we are now
            approaching, of posting these sheets at the last town in Egypt from whence letters can
            be dispatched to <name type="place" ref="#cairo">Cairo</name> with any certainty or
            regularity. I am not without hopes of finding one from you at <name type="place" ref="#kenneh">Kenneh</name>, where, if the wind does not fail us, we shall arrive to
            day or early to morrow; at all events, I trust to have tidings from you on our return
            from Nubia. Will you be so kind as to let Mr. Lawrence have the two little packets of
            seeds of Egyptian plants; he will no doubt raise them in pots, and keep them carefully
            from frost: it is very probable that both may be planted out in the summer. I am
            collecting everything in the shape of seeds I can find, but there are not many of the
            native plants at present in flower, much less in seed; and I fancy I shall reap a richer
            harvest in this way on our return voyage, than in the ascent of the river.</p>

         <p>Tuesday Evening, December 16th. A brisk wind is fast wafting us to <name type="place" ref="#kenneh">Kenneh</name> on the opposite bank of the river, near to which stand
            the magnificent ruins of Dendereh, on which we hope to feast our longing eyes to-morrow.
            The weather is gloriously serene and sunny ? and were it not for the coldness of the
            nights and morn- ings, would be perfect, for the temperature even at midday is that of
            the mildest summer weather: however this night it is somewhat warmer, and our merry
            hearted Nubians are amusing themselves, and, as they would fain believe, us also with
            their native Berber songs, with drum accompaniments; a species of musical entertainment
            we could well dispense with at this moment when we are engaged in making up our budgets
            for home, but we cannot find it in our hearts to stop this noisy, but innocent mirth;
            for no boat's crew could behave better than ours have done, poor fellows!</p>

         <p>I shall look out carefully for small antiquities among the ruins of Dendereh, <name type="place" ref="#thebes">Thebes</name>, &amp;c, and believe that I can be put in
            the way of taking casts of the smaller inscriptions and hieroglyphics, as you take the
            brasses in a church, as Mr. P. has just shewn me one taken off on common paper by
            himself.</p>

         <p>Pray remember me most kindly to all our friends at Ryde, Believing me, always, Your
            affectionate Brother, William Aenold Bkomfield. </p>
