         <p>DEAREST ALICK, </p>
         <p> I am sure you will rejoice to hear that I am really better. I now feel so much like
            living on a bit longer that I will ask you to send me a cargo of medicines. I didn’t
            think it worth while before to ask for anything to be sent to me that could not be
            forwarded to Hades, but my old body seems very tough and I fancy I have still one or two
            of my nine lives left. </p>
         <p> I hope to sail in a very few days, Maurice is going up to <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName> so I send this by him. Yesterday was little Rainie’s birthday, and
            I thought very longingly of her. The photo, of Leighton’s sketch of Janet I like very
            much. </p>
