         <p>DEAREST ALICK, </p>
         <p> I have not written for a long time because I have had a fever. Now I am all right
            again, only weak. If you can come please bring the books in enclosed list for an
            American Egyptologist at Luxor—a friend of mine. My best love to Janet and my other
            chicks. I wish I could see my Maurice. Tell Janet that Hassan donkey boy, has married a
            girl of eleven, and Phillips that Hassan remembers him quite tenderly and is very proud
            of having had his ‘face’ drawn by him, ‘certainly he was of the friends if not a brother
            of the Sitt, he so loved the things of the Arabs.’ I went to the Hareem _soirée_ at
            Hassan’s before the wedding—at that event I was ill. My good doctor was up the river,
            and Hekekian Bey is in Italy, so I am very lonely here. The weather is bad, so very
            damp; I stream with perspiration more than in June at Luxor, and I don’t like
            civilization so very much. It keeps me awake at night in the grog shops and rings horrid
            bells and fights and quarrels in the street, and disturbs my Muslim nerves till I utter
            such epithets as _kelb_ (dog) and _khanseer_ (pig) against the Frangi, and wish I were
            in a ‘beastly Arab’ quarter.</p>
